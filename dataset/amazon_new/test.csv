4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Recipes and menus nearly impossible for a single person There is a lot of excellent information in the book, perhaps worth the price alone. However, I purchased it looking forward to having a month's worth of recipes and menus to follow. Most of the recipes are for 4 servings, some for 2. And the author admits they are nearly impossible to cut in half. Since we are told it is essential to follow the daily menus exactly to benefit from Whitaker's program, the book is nearly useless for a single person living alone.The book is a major disappointment."
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Yikes! This is one of Disney's worst, almost as bad and annoying as Peter Pan. Don't get me wrong - I love Disney. But this is just awful. Slow storytelling, extraneous and unimportant scenes that add nothing...The main characters aren't bad, but many of them are just excuses to add a few more excruciatingly painful minutes onto the film. Whoever approved the release of this film in 1970 was obviously still suffering the effects of a rotten acid trip. Now I know why everyone warned me not to waste my money buying this one! Guess my faith in Disney's usual excellence and quality was ill-founded in this case. Wait for it on TV, but don't go and buy it unless you really like it. Otherwise, stick with Bambi or The Lion King if you want a great Disney critter movie."

The water doesn't come out in too good of a stream and the container takes up too much room in the tub.

That being said I wish I had just paid a little less and got the model without the shower."
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Overall it's great except for the Eraser. The spray is great for getting off all the old marker markings on a white board. Once the bottle runs out which can be pretty quick, I usually just pour in 90% rubbing alcohol which works great. The markers work as they are supposed to they write well I use them once a week to write on a board for game releases so they last a nice amount of time for me but for others I think if your writing a lot everyday there is a good possibility for them to run out in a quick/ reasonable amount of time. Only complaint is the board eraser it just absorbs the old markings and can spread those markings later in time. Even though it is meant to be basic it feels extremely cheap. I just use a paper towel to clean up my white board. Bought this for 9 bucks, if you already have the bottle I suggest getting the markers separately keeping the bottle and using a paper towel for erasing the board."
5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Believe the hype As I was shopping for a new vacuum I started by comparing the 'Dyson' refurbished models, according to the reviews they were not worth the money even though they were reduced prices for refurbished. Then I came across a few testimonies on the 'Dirt Devil' and how powerful it was. The price was reasonable so I ordered it and I am not sorry. In fact I probably would have paid more. The very first time I tried it I couldn't believe how much dirt it picked up. When my brother or my boyfriend used the vacuum they were shocked that it was more powerful than they expected. My only real criticism is that to use the hand-held attachments you literally have to disconnect a tube and reroute the suction to the attachments. Other than that little detail it really is worth the cost and then some. I have a medium pile, light colored carpet and it looks really good after I vacuum."

This is my first iPod and I am impressed with the features. It is a must have for music lovers and video lovers. The only thing that I can complain about is that it could be a little more durable. I say this because it scratches easily but that is nothing a case could take care of. Another flaw that I seen is that it is not compatible with Windows Media Player. That is really a preference though but I think I can adjust to iTunes since it is easier to use. Other than that this new iPod is great and I don't regret purchasing it.

Somehow this event has gained almost legendary status among wrestling fans, for reasons that I don't know. All of the matches are terrible, with the exception of the Funk/Foley final, which is very entertaining. Except for Funk/Foley, the matches in the King of the Death Match tourney are all about five minutes in length, and are laughable attempts at a death match, and/or hardcore wrestling. The Dan Severn match is passable, but he is a bland personality. The Funk/Foley final is historic (probably because every wrestling fan has seen clips) but the finish is terrible, and you can hear them call spots. But still, they bleed buckets, which should satisfy the hardcore vampires. If you must by this, skip to the Funk/Foley final. Everything else is terrible."

At first I was very excited about reading the book. Once I started, it was interesting but began to sound repetitive. I continued reading thinking that this is just the beginning and it will get better. Well, it was still just as repetitive throughout the entire book. It was a good book and should be read by any person who wishes to learn more about why someone acts the way the do. It gives very good feedback and was interesting but it also made it a little hard to get through the book."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","good Program music is that you hear on TV and in film. Today, it is usually odorless synthesizer wash, but in the 1970s, it was funk.Brass Knuckles is such. The title track here sounds like instrumental Blood Sweat and Tears on Blood Sweat and Steroids. Lots of big guitars, echoing horns, and jolly green giant bass. Similar treatments are given to the Beatles ""Come Together,"" and Don McClean's ""American Pie."" Fender Rhodes, guitars that sound like sitars, many a 70s treatment you can dream of is here.During its era this music was dismissed as cheese. But we have come to value funk much more now--and this qualifies-and the mass availability of what we thought was gone forever means mass reevaluation.I am not always crazy about the popifying of a alot of the rock here, but Brass Knuckles can be quite entertaining in its largess. Not essential, but a lot of fun."

Lets be blunt about this, I am without doubt the biggest fan of SRD going and have been from the beginning but as my old dad used to say if it walks,and sounds like a duck it probably is and what this novel isn't is a Chronicle of Thomas Covenant!This may be a socially correct extension of a previously sucessful storyline but it is not part of the greatest fantasy series ever written. The reason the Land exists is Thomas Covenant,not supporting characters. The reason the fans have elevated this series above all others is the love and respect of its main character, to attempt to extend the story without ite heart rings hollow indeed. Congratulations on a wonderful story that would have been more honestly titled Further Adventures in The Land it may have made less money but it would have offended less fans."
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A Misleading Title If the book has a theme, it is that the Dynasty and the Empire were not in irreversible decline and the fall, brought about by defeat in WWI, was not inevitable. Why the title then? Well, towards the end of the book, in a couple of chapters added to the second edition, Sked admits that the title was chosen by his publishers and not by him.My main reason for contributing this review is that I don't think it is clear from other reviews here that Sked's book is not a narrative or comprehensive history of the Habsburg Empire from the Congress of Vienna until its fall. It is rather a series of essays which reflect on other historians' treatment of some of the major themes in Habsburg historiography. These are interesting, challenging, occasionally repetitive, but are not, and do not pretend to be, a substitute for a general history of the period (such as C.A. Macartney's great work)."

I can't believe the people making this movie did such a disgusting thing. For that reason, I'm only giving this one star.Also, the story line itself was terrible and depressing. Ingrid Bergman is beautiful and her acting was great in this movie, but the movie itself was a failure, in my opinion."

If you go see her in concert be prepared to stand up and want to dance. Both times I've seen her perform, groups of people are dancing. In one song she mentions her age, and this Cd shows that age has not slowed her, and for a woman of her age, (Sorry KoKo) she can easily perform as well or better than women half her age. I recommend this Cd with 5 stars because if you like the blues you will love this CD!"
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","the really brilliant record by these 3 The previous record was heavily influenced by David Hentschel and was sonically inferior to this one, although material-wise DUKE and ABACAB are similar. With the new sounds that Collins and engineer Hugh Padgham found here (especially the insanely-compressed percussion) this album launches the band into the stratosphere. Easily my favourite title by them, all the session's outtakes and b-sides are also worth hunting down. ""Who Dunnit"" and ""Keep It Dark"" (the latter a UK 12"" single) are among the cleverest, best recorded that this band ever produced. It's a shame that susequently only the 5-track studio side of follow up 'Three Sides Live' came close to recapturing this magic. I loved this record enough back-in-the-day that I repurchased it for $17 on japanese vinyl, just to wring that last bit of fidelity out of my stereo. IMPRESSIVE!"

Dialog was whisper quiet, yet explosions and other action were thunderously loud. Then there's the HDCP that prevented playing on my home theater computer using PowerDVD Ultra. Played for a while on our Sony player with surround sound, but it was next to impossible to hear what was being said. I could only stand 15 minutes before giving up. Thank goodness it was a rental. It might have been a good movie, but the restricted user operations and the sound mixing completely ruined it for me. No wonder people copy these things, as many legal copies are ruined by how the discs are authored. No sympathy for the MPAA until you can just pop a disc in and play it immediately.

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Wish granted Cut-for-cut, this is probably the best album Pink Floyd ever released: passionate, pained, straightforward, and even powerful in a way that doesn't require the listener to be hyped up and out of their mind on LSD. The merits of ""Shine on You Crazy Diamond"" might be debatable (less so the second half), but there's no debating the power of the rolling satire ""Have a Cigar"" or the even poignant ""Wish You Were Here."" The effects-heavy ""Welcome to the Machine"" even hits the spot. It's ironic that the band members have said that they weren't really ""here"" during the recording sessions, because they've never sounded more ""here"" on any other album."

Mr. Vogt is a wonderful source of knowledge when it comes to World War II history, especially when dealing with the Nazis.

Again what is made most abundantly clear is Mr. Vogt's lengthy academic research into this area. This work makes it easier for all of us to understand a specialized area of history that has been so far unjustly ignored."

Hair-metal was the order of the day. The surprising thing about this cd is RT's ability to merge his classic guitar-riff music with an overall updated sound. The first song, Tear it Up is worth the price of admission. Most of his faithfull fans probably own this disc already. It may not rank with his classic Bridge of Sighs, but still a good guitar rock disc. A good one to add to your collection."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A methodical but savvy tale of the mean streets of D.C. Derek Strange is a P.I. who knows D.C. As a football coach, he teaches young kids lessons that will keep them alive on the drug-infested streets. But when one of his players mistakenly goes home with his uncle and is killed in a drive-by shooting, Derek will do anything to find out who is responsible. His white partner is involved in his own mission to take a young prostitute off the D.C. streets. But to do so, he must first take on the girl's pimp. What makes this book better than most is Strange's flawed character. In this outing, he's having commitment issues with his long-time girlfriend. Can he rid himself of his bad habits, particularly his fascination with massage parlors?"

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Roll through the ghetto pumping 'Ice Ice Baby'... What grabs you when you listen to this album for the first time is the quality and the originality of the production. J-Zone has managed to craft some inventive beats with retro samples that seem to be taken from an old amusement park. He uses violin, trumpet and accordion samples blended with plucked loops that result in a catchy and unique sound. J-Zone is also a good MC that blesses us with sarcastic and vicious rhymes. His lyrics may not be 'deep or conscious' but they manage to be clever enough to be funny and dope.Overall this is a consistently strong album that stands way above average Hip Hop releases and you should definitely check it out."

I think his arrangements are just terrific.I prefer her mature voice. It is filled with richness and emotion and I'm convinced she has lived every single song she sings.

If you get this book or any book, get the tapes too. Otherwise it will do you little good. I used all four volumes when I was learning Japanese. It seems to be as good or better than any of the others I`ve used. Unfortunately, it is full of the supposed cultural explainations for the Japanese which were and are exaggerations or nonsense. (This sort of stuff is typical with 1980s books on Japan which were dwelling on the supposed uniquness of Japanese culture. Uniquly unique. Things such as the Japanese' deep relationship with nature and other silliness.) As a language book, I used them in college with a good teacher and a bad teacher. THe teacher had greater influence on learning than the book. Maybe there are others better--there are many worse--but a search for the perfect book to learn a language will always be a fruitless search."

Yes, the song was recorded for Tumbleweed Connection but was not released with the album, until the remastered version with extra cuts.And it surprises me how many find the drek of Elton John's later pop career (ever actually sat through embarrassments like Rock of the Westies?) superior to his early work.Some excellent and enjoyable work in albums like Don't Shoot Me... and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, but there's a sense from Honky Chateau on that Elton John and Bernie Taupin were purposely dumbing down their work so they could make the big bucks.Certainly understandable, but a shame to see them stop exercising their artistic muscle."

I look forward to doing this workout several days a week. Gilad's Fat Burning Workout has me in much better shape with increased stamina, and I am dripping with perspiration by the end. My other workouts are almost too easy for me now. This is definitely for the intermediate to advanced level, although some of the high impact moves could be modified to low impact or marching in place for beginners.

Watching the dub on CN was awful.. the voices are terrible, the scripts don't always make sence, and they make everyone talk like they were from old england instead of Japan.

The only downfall of the maps was that a signifigant amount of restaurants etc. were missing from the database but I was OK with working around that. The cities are full of narrow, crowded one way streets so just having a funtional GPS to guide us was well worh the cost of the maps. By renting a car we saved several hundred dollars in taxi fare. Round trip taxi fare from the airport to the hotel zone alone was around $150 so you can imagine the Mexico Street Maps more than paid for itsef after a week of driving."

They graciously credited my account.At their suggestion, I then ordered from one of their outside sellers, Import CD's, (my choice of seller) and the CD sounded the same.

Well,the ending turns out a little different(and maybe that's the surprise for those who remember the Eastwood movie),but the dialogue here is great. Bendis is a lot stronger as a writer than an artist,and it shows in this volume. I really liked the 4 page spoof of Jinx as ""The Incredible Jinx"",mocking the Hulk's short lived female counterpart. Bendis even has a page spoofing the Hostess ads found in mid-late 70s Marvel comics! Bendis reminds me of Frank Miller a bit; Both writers/artists who are better with stories than as competition for Frank Frazetta,and both with a noir fascination. Jinx is worth a look....."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Terrible This book manages to efficiently and masterfully destroy any shred of interest and enthusiasm that a student may have for the subject of mathematical probability and statistics. I took a probability and statistics class where the teacher was in no way useful to me. As such, I was forced to rely on this book. I quickly gave up on attempting to obtain even a marginal understanding of the subject and resorted to blindly memorizing formulas and theorems in the hopes that I could deceive the grader into thinking that I was actually competent with the material. I ended up doing well in the class, but despised every moment spent working towards that goal. This book would probably be useful as a reference for somebody already familiar with the subject, or looking to brush up on the material. However, I cannot, in good faith, recommend this book to anybody attempting to learn this subject."

It did not give any warning it was failing, just one day started throwing an ""H98"" error on the display. The manual offers no help, and just says to take it to a service center. Panasonic said the same thing. Seems like it is probably the magnetron. The timer, etc. works fine, and the fan still blows air, just nothing gets heated. I'm off to find out how good Panasonic's warranty service is.On the plus side, Amazon was great about it and gave me a full refund for the failure. If it isn't fixable, I am definitely getting another (non-Panasonic) microwave oven from Amazon."

I'm not a big hard rock...and probably never will be; and to be honest I bought this soundtrack only for the Tori Amos recording ""Carnival""--a satisfying, agressively breathtaking rehash. Unfortunately, not even Tori can save this album from being an overload of mostly mediocre bombastic tracks. Metallica, Foo Fighters, and Chris Cornell (among others) do what they can with what seems to be a restricted approach to heavy music. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect about this soundtrack is the sheer lack of developmental style as disappointingly heard on Limp Bizkit's very poor ""Take a Look Around"" and Rob Zombie's flat ""Scum of the Earth"". Powderfinger, however, is a nice discovery with ""My Kinda Scene"" which drifts softly into a wonderful, if stereotypically, mellow manner. If only there was a mission to replace some of these noisily fizzled-out tracks with whiskey hardened tunes, then maybe we'd have something; but I fear that would be impossible."

Like his other outstanding books Pfanz continues the superior details backed by biographies and personal accounts. Pfanz briefly explains the 1st Day battle and how it basically shaped Union and Confederate positions around Cemetary and Culp's Hill. After bringing the reader into position Pfanz brings you to the frontlines as General Ewell and General Howard collide. Ewell and the Confederates seize the town and sharpshooters abound on roof tops while artillery battles take place between Cemetary Hill and Benner's Hill. Pfanz then captures General Johnson's attack and the Confederate repulse as the Confederates struggle to take Culp's and Cemetary Hill and the final attacks fail and continue to cause extreme bloodshed. Maps are also included to assist the reader with positions and movements which completes this fine book. As with all of Pfanz's work, be prepared for a huge amount of detail followed by descriptive action!"

Sadly, I've never been so unhappy with anything as I am with this mini260 printer. After less than six months, of light to medium use, the printer seems to be worn out. I am faced with either replacing the print head (which Canon happily tells me may not solve the problem), or replacing the printer completely. Further, I have found that the ink cartridges are nearly impossible to find locally (so I order them from amazon), the paper is very expensive locally, and the printer is picky about using only Canon paper. Other papers give very poor print results. The user interface is very 'clicky', and I'm not impressed with the feel of the printer - it's very lightweight and fragile-feeling. Before I purchased this canon printer, I used an HP photoprinter (one of the first) for YEARS and was very happy. Guess what I am about to do now ?"

Stratham races against the clock searching for his original ticker before the replacement runs out of juice.As conceived and executed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, ""Crank 2"" might have had the makings of a genuine cult classic were it not trying so ridiculously hard to impress us.

Fiennes is great as the wounded man trying to come to grips with the way the world really works in his quest for answers for his wife's murder. His performance is his best in quite some time and Rachel Weisz is just amazing, giving a performance that not only proves her to be the most versatile and talented actresses working today but almost locks her up for a Oscar nomination with one of the best performances of the year if not the best.It's a strong and moving theater experience and it will not leave you once the movie ends."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","For Those About To Rock Look, i'm not gonna lie and start gushing about what a fantastic album this is, 'cause it's not. However, that doesn't mean that ""Do Unto Others"" should be sent to the scrap pile. Speedball follows the simple formula of 'Do one thing and do it well.' In this case, it's performing loud, hard-hitting, in-your-face rock songs that get your blood pumping. ""Hog"" is probably the best example of this, however the other tracks aren't exactly lightweights. The album starts and finishes strong, and leaves you wanting to go beat the hell outta something. Considering the low prices this album is commanding, I'd say it's definitely worth owning - especially if you're a stock car driver or else about to break-up a concrete driveway."

I've had a ton of helmets over the years and they all seem to fit my head pretty well - guess I can assume I have a pretty standard skull - and this one appears to be made for odd shaped craniums or neanderthal man.

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Great monopod for 70-200 or lighter I've owned three of these over 20+ years (lost two, leg lock on one broke). They're very good within their limits. Extremely compact, fast (QR leg locks), eliminates the need for a ball head, quick release that doesn't require a special tool. Great with my 70-200 f2.8l/Canon 1D mark II. Saves me from tendonitis carrying the darn thing around all the time.Sure, it's not quite as steady as my Bogen or Gitzo, but the ballhead alone costs more than the Slik EZ Pod. I like that it uses the 1/4"" thread, so I don't have to keep track of a bunch of adapters. Doesn't work that well with the 300mm f2.8l, the lower legs and the pan head just aren't beefy enough.Over a day's shooting, the QR plate will loosen and create a bit of play, but considering that I don't have to fumble around for an allen wrench to tighten it and can switch the plate to a different lens or camera faster, it's a good tradeoff. It's compact and light enough that it's easy to take everywhere."

There is a place on the other end to run a lanyard through but extremely difficult to accomplish. The price is right but the design and function of this thumb drive is extremely poor! Transfer of files is slow as well. I should have returned it but didn't. The work sleek used to describe this drive is more like ""flimsy"".

He also disagrees markedly from others on the value/meaning of 'controversial' emperors (Nero, Domitian, Diocletian) which is very refreshing and well-stated. Frankly, if you want to get a good sense of the meaning of the History of Rome, read Cary first; then Mommsen, then Gibbon. Then, back to Cary. I wish this book were still in print.

This was just another cash grab by the greedy record companies, who threw on ""Embryo"" (which the band stated wasn't even finished yet) as a ploy to entice collectors.As a compilation goes, it's not even a very good one. The one track they use from ""UmmaGumma"" is ""Several Species....""? Then there is absolutely nothing from ""Piper"" or ""Atom Heart Mother.""There are some classic Floyd songs here: ""One of These Days,"" ""Brain Damage,"" ""Eclipse,"" ""See Emily Play"" etc. But there are far superior compilations than this to choose from.

This is a decent book if you are interested in a theoretical treatment of web services but not in building systems that produce and consume web services. Yes, there are examples, but because the book is not tied to a specific web service platform it is not well grounded. I've been working with web services for over a year now. It is easy to speculate about web services architecture in the abstract. However, when you pick a platform to develop web services on, you quickly discover that you have to keep compromising your architecture because of various limitations. This book is unrealistic: it ignores many of the constraints of the real world. Perhaps it is meant for architects that don't have to actually build any software."

They always were accompanied by an armed body-guard of at least a half-dozen mounted soldiers, called knights.""This sounds like a childrens book not a serious history book.

Corelle is very durable and their products last for years. My old set still looked decent so gave it away instead of throwing it out. The sandstone color is very nice. The dinner plates and luncheon plates are a good size. The cereal bowls are a little small. I gave it a 4 star because they don't include the 12oz or 20oz bowls to the set. I have since purchased them to add to my set.

That said, it's by no means a reason to not buy the system. The new box allows for new moves that stretch and tone parts that the other boxes weren't able to get to. Overall, it's a good purchase."

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A great read about two fascinating schools. This book takes its place as one of John Feinsten's best books, along with a book about basketball in the Patriot League (The Last Amateurs) and two golfing books (A Good Walk Spoiled and The Majors). In all of these books, he takes the reader through a season with the athletes, giving fascinating insights into ""their world"". Feinsten seems to have empathy for athletes who are not in big-time programs, and it shows in his writing.I found the descriptions of life and academics in the service academies to be fascinating. It is amazing how the regular students and the players live and practice, compared to students and athletes at most other colleges. And when they're done, they serve in the military for 4 or 5 more years. When you see what these players go through for the chance to play I-A football, it makes the argument for paying major college players - besides providing them a free education, meals, housing, and tutoring - seem lame."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A unique premise Most readers know by now that The Lovely Bones is told from the perspective of a deceased main character, Susie, a young girl who has been brutally raped and murdered. Oddly enough, this seemingly emotion-ladden story comes across as vague and emotionless. Susie's narration is so matter-of-fact that much of the emotional impact of what she is describing is lost. The author portrays the reactions of Susie's family to her death in a very real and well-written manner, yet there is a distance there--perhaps the distance that Susie herself feels as she looks down on her loved ones from heaven. From Susie's perspective, we see heaven as a place that is wonderful yet also sad, as paradise does not prevent Susie from longing for those she left behind. The story meanders through many years, never quite reaching a point of conclusion. Although I found this novel to be disappointing, Sebold certainly has shown significant promise for the future, and I wouldn't hesitate to read her next book."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","VIBE has done it again I think you would have to have been brain dead or asleep for the past decade or so to not have noticed that hip-hop has become the single most important form of art or even communication in the world. Surpassing even the internet, I think history will remember hip-hop as the most important development made by civilization in the last half of the twentieth century. There is little doubt in my mind at least that figures like Dr Dre, 2 Pac, and Snoop Doggy Dogg will, in due course, blot out such lesser figures as (in politics) JFK, (in music) Bernstein, and (in philosophy) Derrida and Foucault who some backward-thinking people still regard as more important than the fathers of hip-hop in our culture. This book does not make my claims, which is why I give it three stars rather than five, but it is certainly an emotional and compelling history of a movement more important than civil rights, the space program, social security, and the first amendment all rolled into one."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Great, except for the concerto The orchestral works by Sibelius are excellent. Very dark and heavy, but dramatic and powerful. The Berlin Philharmonic is excellent on this recording.It would warrant five stars except for the recording of the violin concerto. I can hear that with a good violinist playing (unfortunately, I don't have any other recordings) it could be beautiful, but Christian Ferras at times uses so much vibrato that you can barely hear the pitch (he has one of those wide and fast vibratos that make you shiver). For instance, in the first minute or so of the first movement, there is a hauntingly beautiful violin melody against a sparse orchestral accompaniment, yet Ferras butchers it by playing far too loud and with far too much vibrato. Ferras plays the showy sections correctly technically, but musically he makes them sound terrible. He doesn't make them fit in with the rest of the concerto; he makes some sections sound almost like etudes.The rest of the CD is great. Enjoy."

The ""Konrad"" series is one of my favorites from the Warhammer world. You really have sympathy for Konrad, his plight and sufferings. You also get a great sense of redemption as he performs some truly heroic deeds. Ferring also has terrific prose style and uses great descriptions, dialogue and settings. They're also great for fans of the macabre too since most of Konrad's adventures have him in some truly terrifying places. Spoilers below, don't read if you haven't read the book...........I gave Warblade only 3 stars because of the terrible lack of effort with the ending of the series. It felt like David Ferring was under editorial pressure and had to deliver the goods quick. For a trilogy with so much build-up, the ending was a drop-dead anti-climax and left the reader feeling like they had been punched in the gut. It's really too bad.

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","a.k.a Poligraph Poligraphovich Bortko not only captures the language but the flavor of the novel. He transports you back to early Soviet Russia in grainy black and white that makes you feel as you are watching a movie from that time frame. The actors are great, impeccably carrying out the famous roles that are dear to every Russian. Bulgakov created a literary classic in this tale about a doctor who transforms a dog into a man with darkly amusing consequences. Meanwhile, you see the soviet system closing in around Dr. Preobrazhensky, who has no time for it as he tries to keep his foul-mouthed new creation reined in. But, Poligraph Poligraphovich is as elusive as the mongrel he was created from and finally Dr. Preobrazhensky has no choice but to terminate his experiment. This is satire at its best, a film that is every bit as good as the novel. One can only hope that the film will be made available soon."

To save a bit of money, all the songs but one are set to the tunes of classical music. The last song on the disc, ""Three Is a Magic Number"" is a remade pop version of a very similar song done on School House Rock years ago. Overall, I thought the people who put the lyrics together did a good job. The gimmick of updating classic tunes could have been a disaster, but it isn't: it works rather well. Unfortunately, the album is really short (around 15 minutes) and the most memorable tune is the one pop tune (""Three Is a Magic Number"").

This was followed up by Walking Wounded, and I think the duo has made a graceful entrance into the world of electronic pop music. So being a relatively new fan, I wanted to start building my collection and chose Worldwide. I was fairly disappointed. The album was recorded in 1991 and has an almost eighties, adult contemporary sound. The most recent two albums are better investments and sound more sophisticated.

I hadn't really done a lot of research but was an owner on an Hitachi Camcorder and had numerous electronic problems with it. I found this unit easy to use with one review of the instruction manual. I agree with the person from Orlando that the off/on switch is cumbersome but it is something you have to adjust to. The snap shot feature is great as it gives you a great still picture and breaks up the traditional viewing of a long recording. The clarity of digital is superior as I have my old VHS cassettes to compare it to. I'm in the market for JVC's JLIP unit which allows you to interface the camcorder and computer for downloading pictures. I paid 1/2 the price for this unit vs. the Hitachi and would totally recommend it to the everyday family movie taker.

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Too many words and a terrible ending I have read all of Nelson DeMille's books but this may be my last. His stories are always interesting and fast paced but this one was far too wordy, too long and the ending was a real let-down. 673 pages of chasing a terrorist with no resolution at the end. Additionally, I am getting a bit fed-up with his abundant use of the ""F"" word. It adds nothing to the story or the characters. It was excessive in his novel ""The Generals Daughter"" and was even more so in this one. I can understand occassional profanity to make a character life-like, but he went overboard this time. It cheapens the story. Grisham doesn't do it and neither does Clancy. Both write great stories. DeMille should take a lesson from them."
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A little more information please I have read many of the reviews, and I assume this product works well. But my main gripe here is with amazon and the manufacturer. This product is an amplified antenna, and most amplified antennas require an external power source. However, this product was not advertised as needing an ac adapter, and was even advertised as receiving its power for their amplification through the coaxial cable. While most people who buy this product will not care whether or not they have to plug it in, I bought this antenna specifically because it was the highest rated non-powered antenna. However, this antenna REQUIRES TO BE PLUGGED IN TO WORK PROPERLY. In addition, they boast that this antenna has a ""small footprint."" This is the third antenna I have purchased, and it was by far the biggest. It is definitely more interesting looking than most. But being aesthetically pleasing does not somehow make it smaller."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Emotionally moving experience. The soundtrack for ""The Cell"" is as emotionally jolting as the film itself, capturing all of the pain and intensity that the movie conveys to its audience. Howard Shore uses mostly strings and hints of new age chords to evoke the proper emotions for each unique scene. While certain moments in the music are meant to make the audience jump during the film, this soundtrack is mostly an emotional one, especially in the ending sequences of the film. Shore's gift with music especially shines here, and this is a soundtrack that is sure to please."

Gov. Cellucci, who may be an indirect supporter of John Connolly, assigned the current Commissioner of DSS, Jeffrey Locke. If Whitey had a child, was this child targeted as the child attended the alma mater of agent John Morris? Has the child been systematically harassed and had their reputation destroyed in Massachusetts by either the government or perhaps rival mobsters or both? If there was a child, was the child prevented from finding work by screening their calls? If there was a child could it have become imperative to make the child look like a failure or less than spectacular performance in school? Was NSA, located where a Kennedy family member is governor, involved?Did the child seek help after receiving harassment from forces alleged to be loyal to Gov Cellucci and Scott Harshbarger?"

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A Very Old Retrospective Alas, this was a great disappointment. The documentary dates form 2009 and it is clear that Mr. Domingo's narrative was filmed around that time. However, all of the clips are from decades earlier--one has to guess exactly since none are dated. Therefore, no development of his acting, singing or, for that matter, looks, are provided. His colleagues in the performances are not named--so one has to know that it is Kire te Kanawa or whoever else. An equally large negative surprise was the fact that none of the clips are from performances at the NY Metropolitan Opera. Is this due to copyrights, the unwillingness of the documentary makers to pay royalties, or something else?There are plenty of documentaries out there regarding Placido's contemporaries that move, educate and uplift. This one on Placido, unfortunately, is not one of them---by a long shot. Wish I could get my money back."

Although it is a wonderful ""concept"", this toy absolutely does NOT deliver what is promised...it is nothing at all like the commercials on television. It is difficult to move the pegs to the desired color, and once they are in place, they move out of position easily making it very frustrating for the child. It is almost impossible to see any image on the screen whether with the lights on or in total darkness. In short, what we thought/hoped would be a safe and portable alternative to the Lite Brite turned out to be nothing more than money thrown down the drain.

The one thing that sets Korn apart from Judas Priest is that they cannot play, sing, or write music. It seems that Korn's lead singer always talks about how his life sucks and he wants to commit suicide. Well, GET OVER IT!!!!

Once you switch the default IP to your subnet, it's really easy. Could be a little more powerful or come with a directional antenna. Signal strength drops of noticably after 40 feet when going through a couple regular house walls (still very usable, just not at the fastest speeds).

I was afraid I would go through the whole bottle in less then a week.

I understand that it is a good reflection of all of the above, but the selection wasn't as infectious as I had hoped.

Don't get me wrong, lunges are great but it seems to be more lunging than anything else. Im hoping this dvd will grow on me once I can get all of the moves down correctly.

This book is less about the band and more about how they record, why they do it, and what the environment around them looks or feels like while they are doing it. It's an open-minded look at a process most of us don't enjoy on the same scale, but that we can all relate to in our own creative lives.The accusations of pretense are understandable. But if you are someone who loves the process as much as the finished product this will be an inspiring piece. The cd and the book fit perfectly together in creating a mood of idea exploration. I found this book insightful and a very nice addition to a progressingly great body of work."

But all in all, and interesting book that I enjoyed overall. At least provokes some serious thought on the subject, and on ancillary topics such as politics, religion, and marriage.

The only song on ""Downward Is Heavenward"" that really stands out to me is track #6, ""Green to Me"". I really like the way that song kicks in. The rest of the cd ranges from mediocre to almost good. I must agree with some of the other reviewers who compliment Hum's ability to create heavy melodies. I would like to hear how Hum would have honed their creative and technical abilities over the years had they not disbanded (so I am told).Bottom line...

Typical of homemade documentaries, it's childishly manipulative and simpleminded in its intention. The cutesy-poo director does a lot of yammering that leads to bigger questions about population control and global industrialization, which are neglected with convenient conviction. Are people really dying off too quickly in the new millenium? Is there any evidence that vegans are more sympathetic or less cruel than carnivorous consumers? Is being a vegan more rational than not? Is vegan recruiting stupid?In the end, moderation in all things seems to be the simple solution. You won't be missing too much if you want to pass this one up."

Kuklinski's wild fabrications about all the men he murdered have already been debunked by other reviewers and at various sites on the web. The man was, clearly, a pathological liar. Even so, his lunatic ravings could have been a good read if Philip Carlo were a better writer. The book is repetitious and amateurishly written. The creepiest thing about it is Carlo's infatuation with Kuklinski. His fawning over the killer's height, strength, cat-like grace, and high cheekbones made me want to hurl.Pass this one up. There are many better true crime books available."

I assume that the collar released but the release reason is unknown. I never found the collar. Without tags he is not safe from pickup by the animal control officers. I changed to an elastic collar and a new tag. Within a week the second set of tags and the cat were missing. Simply stated ""keep your cat indoors"". Mine was safe for 17 years as an indoor cat. He desperately wanted outdoors part of the day. He escaped and I lost him regardless of whether he has a collar or a microchip. My other two cats were this brand and type of collar but they stay indoors. The bells assist me in knowing where they are in the house. If they lose thier collars, I can always find it within the house and reattach. I am fine with the collar for indoor cats."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Not for flavored coffees This grinder looks cool and does a good job with plain beans, but it does have a couple of problems:1. You absolutely cannot use flavored coffee beans with this grinder. They get stuck in the exit spout and jam up the machine. This can burn out the motor very quickly if you don't catch it in time.2. The exit spout for the beans is rather long and a lot of grinds get left in it after using.3. The grinder is quite loud.I've had two of these grinders over the last 3 years. The first one worked great but the motor got burned out when a house guest tried to run flavored coffee through it without babysitting to make sure the grinds didn't jam up. KitchenAid was kind enough to replace the broken grinder under warranty. Now I reserve this unit for plain coffees and have a Krups for flavored beans."

I ordered the Terk VR-1 TV Volume Regulator about a year ago. It quit working after about a week so I returned it for a replacement. The replacement worked for about 2 months and then quit working also.EDITED - 2 Years later...This is the fourth Terk VR1 Automatic TV Volume Controller I have purchased. It works great - just as advertised but it could / should be a lot more durable. Nothing else on the market does the job - so each time I buy one I hope maybe this time it will last for more than a few months.The only competition to this unit I could find (""TV Volume Regulator"") is a complete waste of money since it raises the background noise to the same level as bombs dropping. In other words, raindrops are as loud as gunfire.So until there is something better, I keep buying the Terk (now Audiovox) because it is the only unit I could find that really does the job.If the unit was more durable I would easily rate it 5 Stars."

Other than that and a few other tracks not needed (""Take Me Home"", ""Terror Era""), the album would've been much better. Instead of trying for the pop crossovers, as attempted on ""Streets of NY"", they should've just stuck to the harder beats like ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Me"" (where Tony Sunshine actually spits a verse, a nice one too), ""Yeah, Yeah, Yeah"" (Remy Ma destroyed this track), and the harder ""Let Them Things Go"". On top of that, ""True Story""'s main focus only seems to be Fat Joe and Remy Ma instead of the whole group.

This is my first review on Amazon but I felt compelled to express my disdain about the audio quality of this product.I researched the product on various message boards and they seemed to indicate that this was the result of the microphone gain being adjusted in quiet environments. To my dismay, it seems that the noise is picked up in any environment because the motor mechanism is simply very very loud. The noise is captured on tape and is so loud it is hard to filter out without ruining the sound track.I purchased a Panasonic GS14 and while the CCD isn't as good as the JVC's, there is no motor noise at all. The difference is night and day.My advice is to pass on this model as the noise is very excessive and ruins an otherwise competent product."

I wanted to buy another for my daughter. This Rumford Garden Pro Transplanter is tough and light like my old ones. The angle is nice, but unfortunately it is too large in both the blade and handle for smaller feminine hands. It is also green, which makes it easy to misplace in the summer garden."

Also, the practice tests are so-so. They are somewhat different than the real test and don't buy this book only because it has 6 tests while others have 2 or 3 (there is NO way you can do all of the tests unless you stay home all day and study. Still the practice tests do help a bit. I recommend this book to anyone.

A woman in hot pursuit in Nazi Germany runs through town in a long white evening gown from a country house to a double agent's house and then to a friend's house. No one sees her. Ridiculous. Important documents are locked in a cellar, but wala! The key is above the door - who would have ever thought of that? She poses as a cook and does an awful job, the food is poor and she spills soup on an officer, gets fired but that same high ranking Nazi officer offers her a job caring for his children. Oh sure. Sorry, this one was too predictable and poorly written."
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","The Beach House By: James Patterson Peter Mullen was a valet at the most exclusive East Hampton party. During a break, he was advised to go to the beach by an anonymous perfumed note. He thought he'd get lucky. Instead, he lost his life.When his body washed up on the beach, the authorities called it suicide. Jack Mullen (Peter's brother) knew it wasn't true. His brother would never go swimming in a stormy tide, much less kill himself during a work break. Mullen's family and other Montauk ""townie"" friends demand and investigation. However, the authorities are less than cooperative, preferring to protect Barry Neubauer, the wealthy CEO who hosted the party that fateful evening.Jack risks his future law career to find answers regarding Peter's death, but his inexperience is no match for Neubauer's counsel. When Jack's friends are threatened, the covered-up murder is confirmed."

A couple days later I found my 6th generation 80g iPod I had lost months ago!When I got the case I figured it may just fit on the 5th gen and that it'd be too big for the 6th gen.Well after getting it, I tried it on both and it worked on both!So I'm keeping it on my 6th generation iPod!The cover looks even better in person and the scroll wheel cover gets about 80-90% use compared to no cover at all.The downside is that it doesn't seem as durable as i'd hope (it is plastic though) and the headphone jack may not be big enough for some headphones (fits regular iPod earbuds just fine though)."
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Evolving pleasure I initially wrote a tepid review. I take it back. This is not tepid, but mixed. It's like going back to an old lover and finding that their body doesn't fit you quite the same way. Not bad, just different. It took a while for this album to grow on me. I'm a dedicated folkie, and the jazz riffs left me a little cold. Her lyrics are still incisive, but where they used to give me goosebumps, now they just strike me- 'oh, that was a good line...' She is still an amazing wordsmith. But I felt that the new sound left precious little room for that primal voice of hers to get the real point across.That said, I respect her defiant transformation as an artist. Art has to evolve, and repeating one's past success only leads to staleness. This CD may not have had the visceral impact on me that her others have, but I am eager to see what comes next from someone that I can only characterize as a tsunamic artist."

So, I bought this.I followed the instructions on cleaning the existing toilet. I removed the paper cover from the top of the seal and stuck it to the toilet around the horn. It didn't seem to be sticking properly; it felt like a spot wasn't sealing. When I moved it a little bit to check the adhesion, the entire seal fell off as if there were no adhesive at all.This was a complete waste of my money. Maybe I did something wrong, I'm still trying to figure it out."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","don't believe the hype Granted, this is dark, beautiful and lovely music but most certianly it is not Richard's best work (see I Care Because You Do for that). Why people are hyping this as the best aphex twin release is beyond me. Track 1 and 4 on disc one are amazing and I really like disc two a lot but at times this music is montonous, drony and not very interesting. It's soothing to listen to while in bed, reading or just puttering around the house but overall nothing leaps out and grabs you. This has been done before by other artists years before Richard did it. Check out Chris + Cosey's Elemental 7, same atmospehrics, textures and dark moods. Of course it sounds a bit primitive by today's standards given the fact that their release was made around 1983 but at that time it really WAS cutting edge. aphex twin in comparison is a novelty. I love apehx twin and what Richard is capable of doing with electronic music but really this isn't his best. His best music is more interesting than this."

Tombstone and Wyatt Earp may be about the same subject but both are vastly different, nearly equally great films and while I love Costner's film I will give the slightest edge to Tombstone and rate it as one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time."

Do yourself a favor, stay away from this CD, and ""The Kenny Rankin Album"" (another Don Costa production). I'm going to try again with Kenny, but I'll stick to his later stuff and his ""live"" stuff. He's best when it's just him and his guitar or piano--he's great, he doesn't need any ""help."""

While the bulk of the tracks are relatively lightweight pop, Shango is more listenable and pleasant than many later Santana releases, including Supernatural, and the romantic numbers ""Hold On"" and ""What Does It Take"" substantiate themselves by putting some feeling in. ""Nowhere to Run"" is more innocuous than bad. My favorite is ""Oxun,"" a saga of deliverance but with only ebullient music. Still, the highlight is ""Nueva York,"" in which Gregg Rolie, the keyboard wizard of the group's early days, returns to provide some great Hammond organ flourishes."

For example, I've felt that I could use some bodywork training -- this book's descriptions of Alexander, Feldenkrais, and all the others helped me see quickly that Alexander will best suit my needs. Homeopathic, aromatherapy, flower essences, all forms of meditation and psychotherapy, chiropractic -- virtually everything is there, with attractive photographs, beautiful layouts, and handy sidebars that clearly list the ailments for which any given alternative therapy could be expected to provide benefits.

Did he alienate anybody? Were there any character flaws? Also, I was looking to learn more of an insider's view of Gemini and Apollo, but it was all very superficial, heard-it-before material. I'd read a bit about Conrad, like his attempt to smuggle onto the moon a huge cowboy hat to fit over his space helmet, or his attempt at trick photography on the lunar surface, hoping to befuddle the photo analysts later. Neither of these gems were in the book. He's a great guy, a pilot's pilot, a problem-solving magician with a live-for-the-moment spirit.

As with David Lean's DOCTOR ZHIVAGO it is about a few years in the turbulent life of the all-female Anglo-Soviet assembly. The Spy and Spice Girls have plenty of character, and that helps make up for the lack of action and adventure that keeps their movie debut from being a truly epic motion picture. The concert scene at Albert Hall in London was very reminiscent of Hitchcock's THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. It was kind of a 90's version on some of his themes as well as David Lean's and those of the Bond producers. However, it has a potential of being cult epic like AUSTIN POWERS. Perhaps not. Perhaps time will be kind to these spicy gals."

BUT (and it's a HUGE BUT!) it sounds like a never-ending Neil Schon solo - nearly straight through the entire three hours. While the new lead singer has very ""Perry-esque"" vocals, it's not the Journey I remember. Too bad too, because they were one of Bill Graham's greatest bands. Hope Bill wasn't watching from on high! Don't bother."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","This book is terrible, but, sadly, I've read worse Sally Wentworth always wrote very well, her prose attentive and skillful, but this book was bizarre. Hugo holds his wife Kate captive, thinking she lied about being a virigin and has now cheated on him. She's a virgin, of course, but he accuses her of being the sluttiest slut who ever did slut. Honestly, I think Hugo was turned on by the idea...but disgusted at himself for being turned on, so he takes his aggression out on the heroine/victim.This book is missing a critical piece in a romance novel: any semblance of romance. There is no communication, only accusation, abuse, torture, stubbornness, pride and outright stupidity. If the author had included some inkling of a love and affection between the two characters, some sort of true remorse or process of healing, perhaps it could have been redeemed. The Judas Kiss by Sally Wentworth is one my favorite Harlequin Presents. Shattered Dreams is on the other side of the spectrum."

I don't think this novel is up to her usual writing style and story line standard.This is the story of Gayla, a beautiful, single, Black art gallery manager in New York. She is the mother of Allison, who is very obviously half-white. An old acquaintance comes on the scene with ""new-age"" art and a relationship develops. Meanwhile Allison's father reappears and finds out he has a teenage daughter.I've read and reveiwed many of Ms. Kitt's books and novellas, with very favorable ratings. This one didn't measure up."

Even drawing comparisons to du Maurier's grandfather and contrasts to the great Bronts, all is lost in her attempt to move Daphne du Maurier out of this shallow genre and into one of a more academically acceptable category.

A character that got my attention was Scout. She was a strong-willed and courageous girl who knew when to stand up for what is right.

I missed ballet and was looking for something that would help me keep up with it- and give me a workout as ballet does, from the comfort of my own room. I feel like this was made for those without any or much ballet experience. But at the same time, the way it is shot/edited at times makes it hard to follow. When a step is being demonstrated suddenly it goes to a black and white zoom on the instructor's upper body, when what you need to see is her feet! Furthermore I'm disappointed with the non-ballet muscle toning parts. It's nothing special, crunches and push up, which when I'm buying an excersive video I don't want the abdominal excersizes to be all crunches- I could come up with that on my own.It's not awful, ther are things I like, but overall it's not as good as I was expecting."

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",Among my favorite books This book made me laugh and cry several times. It is the only book which has brought out such emotions in me. The ordeal which Jeorg the sniper has to undertake to survive the war is just amazing. What's even more amazing is that it's all true. You can imagine the sounds of battle because they're all familiar sounds (sort of like when you read a Star Wars book). Let's all hope humanity never has to go through a war like that again!
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Not a bad book, but not great. First, when I picked it up I was disappointed to find it was actually a series of short-stories, some of which I've already read in other collections (Answers to Soldier comes to mind). Some of these were new, however, and they did hang together fairly well. I've always enjoyed Mr. Block's writing and these stories were no exception. I think a few of the previous reviewers missed the point that the book was not so much about a hired killer, but about an everyday man with a decidedly different profession. Perhaps Mr. Block may miss some technical aspects of being a hired gun, but he really knows how to make his characters seem alive."
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A Real Gem This is an excellent police procedural in the serial killer genre. Devlin's characterizations are strong; and the main characters, though familiar in their outlines, have enough nuances to make them individual and three dimensional.The writing is very insightful, and Devlin's analysis of the complexities of relationships is spot on target. The antagonists are real, with such tragic bends in their psyches as to render them pitiable while at the same time revolting. The backdrop in San Francisco is a nice change from so many stories of this type set in NYC. Devlin is an excellent writer and storyteller, and I eagerly await his next novel--hoping it's a continuation of the relationship between Rose, Joshua, Seamus, and murder."
5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",A Story that must be told This film is a must see. To little is known about the true ruthlessness of the Soviet era. As pointed out in the film it did not stop when Stalin died. American schools do not teach this and a recent column by Barry Rubin pointing out just how this has been glossed over and ignored by virtually everybody. Not only should you watch it but it should be shared with all who will sit for it.One critique I might have is when they go into Trotsky's murder they should tell you that he set up Lennin's secret policde and did mor than a little murder himself. He was no marter.

They are in the pulp fiction style of several plots that more or less merge at the end."

For goodness sakes, everyone in touch with Liath is impressed with her as a stand-up for yourself person, yet whenever she gets near Hugh she becomes a doormat. I know it's all in the hands of the writer but please continue to give Liath the tools she uses in her relationship with the rest of her life and allow her to nueter Hugh with a very dull blade soon. If not, I don,t know if I can wade my way through the remainder of this series.The new characters of Anna and Mathiue are intriguing as long as Ms. Elliot allows Anna to remain and grow from there and not become the milqtoast she allowed Liath to become."

The 3 games that really make it worth it is Laser Hockey (similar to pong but much better), Billiards, and Tanks. You get to actually play someone or the CPU (except for Billiards you're on your own if you play by yourself) so it's different every time.

Turn, Magic Wheel does not, however, match Powell's later works such as The Golden Spur or The Wicked Pavilions.

Questions to ask yourself: Are you and your loved one ""best friends""? Do you have common values and interests? Do both of you consider your _commitment to your marriage_ as the most important aspect of your mutual values? Are you willing to compromise with your partner? Have you discussed parentage? (having children places the greatest strain on a marriage.)This is a fine publication, and worth your while."

I initially loved the price point and i had read that after a few shaves it would most likely stop shedding. That never happened. This brush shed at least 10 hairs per shave, every shave. It got to the point that when I would shake the water out of the brush that a few hairs would fall out. I took excellent care of the brush making sure to dry it in a brush holder and to never leave any soap in it. Today as I was shaking the water out of the brush for a shave the knot flew right out of the handle. Good thing I have a backup brush. What a piece of garbage this brush is."

No background information is given on anyone in the book and the quotes from the dead girl's two best friends are contrived and cliché. We learn nothing about the murdered girl or those accused.Worse is the extremely poor writing of the author who at one point uses the word ""precluded"" instead of ""preceded.""There are literally chunks and chunks of text that are repeated verbatim throughout the book.

Schisto was a really nice guy and Pele was always the one bringing in those new very cute Brazilian players to the team, Marino stands out in my mind. I'm so glad they captured the offices and especially the doors of the elevators with the pictures of the Players on them and the BRIGHT yellow phones! No shots of the parties at the Stadium Club though after the games. That was where you would always see the players and the guests. Eric Heiden stands out most in my mind.

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A woefully overlooked Altman masterpiece A woefully overlooked film, this is one of my very favorite by Altman. Amazing acting by Tim Roth and Paul Rhys, and the whole film is tremendously moving.For me, Altman achieves a sort of dream state far more interesting than in the more critically acclaimed `3 Women'. He manages to make you feel the whole story as completely real, as if you were there in history, and yet, it has a fractured, dreamlike quality, with moments left unexplained and mysterious, but always making emotional sense.I don't know any film that better captures the pain of being an artist, or the pain of being unable to save someone you love. Also, the whole film looks gloriously like a painting.There is a longer version, originally made for European TV, but I actually think the rhythms are far better in the US theatrical cut. The Euro version mostly adds tons of exposition that takes away from the mysterious, subjective tone that makes this work so well."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Not that good Whiting is a pretty well known writer who has churned out a number of bios on WWII people. However, his bio of Heydrich falls short mainly because he spends too much of the book writing about other people. He spends numerous pages describing the people who planned and exectued the assassination of Heydrich rather than discussing Heydrich. Too much of his work seems to be conjecture and speculation also. While Heydrich is one of the most hated and fascinating people of WWII and the Nazi party, this book is not the best to learn about him. Unfortunately, there are few bios on this important person. One interesting thing about this book is Whiting's contention that the economic system set up by Heydrich in the 1930s and early 40s is the same one being used today by the European Union. Other than that, not too good."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Satisfying conclusion Shadow of the Giant provides a pleasing, if not surprising, finale to the Bean saga--and leaves potential openings for Card to revisit the Ender universe. The writing is on par with the other Bean stories, and doesn't degenerate into massive passages of exposition about politics like the two previous books. Also, because the main foil of Shadow of the Hegemon and Shadow Puppets died at the end of the latter book, it doesn't dwell on what was ultimately a poorly developed villain and instead focuses on the protagonists. Unfortunately, that focus too often reveals that the protagonists aren't really that interesting. As usual, most of the supporting cast, with the exception of Peter Wiggin, is underdeveloped and has mostly stock (and culturally stereotyped) characteristics.

While this is definitely a departure from what we're used to hearing from Gary Puckett, it's no surprise that he recorded such a collection given the fact that he's a born-again Christian. If anything, his voice has gotten better with age & this CD is additional proof of his versatility as a performer. In addition to rock & ballads, he's performed blues, country, & just about everything else in between with the exception of rap & opera. This is a CD I'm looking forward to playing while decorating the Christmas tree. I still play it from time to time even now, because the music is really timeless. Nice work from probably the nicest guy in the music business!!"

Instead of an insightful, thought provoking fiction, it proved to be a negative inticement for young readers. Children, be careful what you read and what you watch. Being intrigued by the darker side of things is understandable, but it is dangerous and unwise. My concern is that our society is embracing what my generation would never have tolerated. It is not the book itself that is so scarry, but it is that parents are allowing their children to absorb the ideas, values, and practices of books like Harry Potter and The Egypt Game.

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Male bias This book is written along with 99% of self help books that focuses on the male as the abusive partner. It is as if we live in a society where very rarely the women is the perpetrator of physical and verbal abuse. This of course, plays into politics and womens liberation, whereas it is almost as if they are entitled to act this way. I would imagine that there is a rather large percent of women abusers in today's civilization. In a society where single parents, mostly women, are the caretakers, there must be a very strong pattern developing in the present and the future. The book is an answer to prayers where it does in fact focus on significant issues.

The other annoying thing about this book is on every page there are little cartoon like blurbs with tiny little bits of information. It's the exact same format as the ""Windows or any other book for Dummies"". If you look hard enough, you might find some pictures to look at as well. The book lacks any decent photography. Nothing in color and some good pictures of buildings where Rush once had been. The other non clear pictures are all pictures you've seen before.

It would not matter if Lee Strobel interviewed God in person, someone like Earl Doherty would come along and convince many that it was all a lie. The overall picture is this: if you don't want to accept the gift of salvation offered by God through Jesus, then you will find any excuse available to deny it. However, don't use Doherty or anyone else's theories to keep you away from Jesus. If you TRULY seek to know God, He will reveal Himself to you - that's His promise to all of us."

As a parent and teacher it breaks my heart to know that anyone who is labeled as shy would read this book and think there is something psychologically wrong with them that needs to be fixed. Modern society and the educational system focus way too much on extroverted preferences and performance. So many productive, intellectual, insightful people are introverts who prefer to be in social situations that don't demand that we be something that we are not, extroverted. Shyness is a label given to those who don't fit into the behavioral expectations of extroverted parents, teachers, and bosses. We would not be where we are in civilized history without inwardly focused thinkers, writers and problem solvers. We used to call quiet, reserved, thinking people wise, now we call them shy, lacking in self-esteem and not team players. Not only is the book outdated, so is the term shy and so are the expectations that everyone in school and society should fit into the same mold."

""Superhero Movie"" is much better than the earlier ""movie"" parodies by the same people, but unfortunately, not that much better. Drake Bell is appealing as the Peter Parker-type teen who gets bit by a dragonfly and develops superpowers. Other cast members, including Leslie Nielson and Sara Paxton as the love interest (mugging like Kirsten Dunst) do a good job, too, but they can't make such a lame script funny. Unless of course, you find flatulence really funny. There's lots of farting in this movie. And a few small clever bits, but they are few and far between.

Sarah Ann Webb's husky pipes and arrangements have improved especially on the jazz funk of ""Midnight"", the disco of ""Always"", the urgent aching balladry of ""Should I?"", the early 80's synth-funk of ""Phunky Times"" and the jazz torch swagger of ""Your All I Need"".

But, other then that, it's a sub par album. Music wise, it's alright...songs like ""Dead Cell"", ""Broken Home"", and ""Between Angels and Insects"" and cool music.

I've read all the SSR books, and was very excited when this one came out. However, the story was rather flat and much of the ""life"" has slipped out of Slippery Jim. Many parts were entirely too predictable, while others were just plain not believable. I really got the impression that Harrison decided to do this book just for a bit of added revenue, as it seemed his heart really wasn't in it. Overall, I'd say you're better off skipping this particular entry in the tale of Slippery Jim and keep your fond memories of him intact."

The perches seem comfortable for the small birds. Sometimes 3 or 4 birds dine at once, but mostly they take turns on it.The discarded hulls of the black sunflower seeds made a mess on my patio. So, I hung a 2' diameter planter under it to catch the discards. I don't have a squirrel problem, so this has been fine. After just a few weeks, the planter is full of sunflower sprouts. Chickadees also discard a lot of whole seeds. (The ones they cannot crack easily?) The finches sit on the planter and pick them out. The finches also sit in the planter and graze the discards, so hanging a simple platform feeder underneath would be another solution for patios."

I felt as if the book weren't just trying to convince me that Christianity is Jewish, but that I should be Christian. Maybe these feelings come from what I brought with me when I began this book, but Edith Schaffer approaches this topic from a /very/ Christian point of view, almost never trying to approach it from the side of a non-Christian. Though her point that Christianity comes from Judaism is well founded, she doesn't convince me that Christianity and Judaism didn't split ways centuries and millinea ago.Also, there are a number of fallacies in the book, such as the statement that Abraham only had one son or that Noah's ark was available to any who wanted on. Such incorrect statements, particularly on a topic she should know well, set her back on the credible front."

Don't get me wrong, CD 2 is good (Am I Evil, Stone Cold Crazy, & Breadfan), but Metallica of the past thrash is rehashed by every other new thrash metal band.

He covers all of the major domains within School Psychology and sagely advises you to first consider your areas of ignorance and progressively move to your areas of strength. I, for one, had to extensively review case law and ethics. Others will likely find a need to review general psychological principles. Thompson assumes that you are aware of your strengths and weaknesses and is very capable of pointing you in the right direction if you indeed are aware. If not, however, preparation time will increase substantially. That being said, however, Thompson suggests highly recommended other sources (Thomas and Grimes, 2004; Hale and Fiorello, 2004) that will likely lead you to NASP Exam success."

In other Wrox books you build the example code so that you understand it, but with this book, you download it (it doesn't always work) and the authors dive right into it.

In his shoes steps John Paul Jones who substituted the dense string orchestrations of his Sixties production career with cheezy synths.

I use it after showers just as a way to feel a bit more fresh. It has very little lasting power on my skin. I would say it lasts about an hour and then it can no longer be smelled on me. It does smell good while it lasts, but I think a few more fragrance notes would be nice. Cloves smell good, but I would rather smell like a mix of cloves and other things, rather than JUST cloves."
5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Cultivating an attitude of gratitude I've heard in order to have a happy life we have to practice the habit of being a good finder. Whatever we go looking for that is what we find. The practice of the habit of finding good, and being grateful on an everyday basis is a real changer for my life, and this helps to make it a daily habit. I like to use mine in the evenings, typically when I can fall into the bad habit of grumbling about the normal every day stress-ors of life. Being grateful helps me to be more content and treat others more respectfully, which of course then translates into me getting more out of my own life."

This worked just like any other dog shampoo I've used. My dogs were not any brighter than they normally were after a bath. Of course they seemed whiter, since I washed away all the dirt from their coats - like it ALWAYS does. This is just like any other shampoo. The clincher: I didn't care for the scent at all. That is a personal thing, I know, but if I am going to spend money on something, I want to enjoy using it. I won't be buying this again after I am out of this stuff. There are cheaper options that clean my dogs just as well."

To put this review in perspective, I should say that I bought this DVD strictly in an attempt to test the potential of my new entertainment system setup. Upon arriving at the final battle scene, my shameless goal was happily realized. However, the mundane tripe that I had to wade through before hand almost made the journey an unbearable one. While almost always pleasing to the senses, the movie had absolutely no substance... especially to justify a revisitation. Therefore, rent the DVD. However, be sure to enjoy and marvel at the efforts (documented nicely in the special features) the amazing talents at the ILM (arguably the only ones in this production) had put towards this film."

The insults, the intentionally bad grammar, the mean plots, the poorly behaved kids: all bad role models for children. Common Sense Media goes farther and writes, ""[Junie B. Jones] behaves outrageously, which is the source of the humor, but the author never really lets us know why, which means the reader is usually laughing at her, rather than in sympathy with her."" Junie is obnoxious and similar to real live bratty kids -- not something we should be encouraging.My daughter and I actually really like Pippi Longstocking.

Rafe may start off as being crass and putting up walls - but as the story continues we find out why and the interaction between these three characters was super.I really liked that there was no wavering from Syndelle - she recognized her mates and is willing to face life head on. Also really enjoyed the continuation of seeing Skye, Gian and Rico. Also Roman - who is in book three is introduced."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","One Thumb Halfway Up I share Steve Sullivan's fascination for glamour girls, but was rather disappointed in the women he selected for this book. Virginia Bell was singularly unattractive and has been justifiably forgotten; Cynthia Myers was an overrated and depraved doxy, ideal for the usually vulgar Hugh Hefner and the always vulgar Russ Meyers; Sabrina was, at best, a third-tier entertainer; and I've never understood why Sheree North was considered even remotely attractive. The book is saved, at least to some degree, by the chapters on more interesting women -- e.g., Yvette Vickers.Sullivan's criteria for his selection is a mystery. To be sure, there are glamorous women other than Monroe and Mansfield worth writing about, and they can be from the second tier, such as Sue Ane Langdon. But why focus on what amounts to the bottom of the barrel? A pity."

I filed my set of keys to one of our vehicles to make it work (guy thing, was determined to prove that it was a good buy).

The tuner is sensitive, but once you get it on a station, it sticks. The flashlight is OK. The emergency siren is OK. The back battery panel is going to pop open if you drop it. Although this product is multi-purpose, in a real emergency I will only care about the hand crank, the flashlight, and the weather (emergency broadcast) station.Three years later we had to use this for real during a fire in the area.

Imperial Japanese forces perpetrated atrocities in Nanking, like they did years later in Singapore, Burma, and Manila - there is no denying that.( Whether the overwhelming evidence to support this is classified by Japanese history as ""military operations"" is a totally separate subject.) But how many casualties constitute a massacre? Is the death toll really significant?

Not to mention that a vast majority of the ""scientific ideas"" are really ""straw man"" arguments that are so watered down (or just plain misrepresented) that they become easy targets to those predisposed to attack them. I can only imagine this book would be persuasive to someone without a background in biological science. Do youself a favor and skip this one. A much better and more thoughtful read can be found elsewhere (I would suggest Richard Dawkins or Carl Sagan of course, but Gary Marcus's new book The Birth of the Mind is also spectacular not only in its new ideas, but in its summary of current biological science---something the ""Search for God"" sorely needs)."

I recommend this CD to anyone who has fond memories of Alphaville's music.On the plus-side, stand-out tracks include ""Guardian Angel,"" ""Wishful Thinking, ""Dangerous Pieces,"" ""Pandora's Lullaby,"" and ""Wishful Thinking Physical.""On the minus-side there are some tracks that go on just a bit too long to support the flimsiness of the song in question (""Flame"" and ""Point of Know Return,"" and ""Soul Messiah"" are the greatest sinners as far as this goes).The good, however, far outweighs the bad on this CD, so in the end it stands as one of the best Alphaville albums I've heard."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Gets Better Later On At first this book was quite easy to put down, but it got better towards the end as the climax of Corky's plan came about and we wondered how Ethan, Dunny, and Hazard would thwart it. I have read every single Dean Koontz book in print and it seems that the older he gets the more philosophical he's become, and even seems as if he is tired of writing things that contribute too much to the clear and persistent evil we see in post-September 11th America. Those customers who cite this as the greatest novel he ever wrote need to grab yourselves a copy of Watchers or Strangers and settle in for a long page-turning night of suspense. His books are now good, but I just can't work up the amazed excitement and wonder his previous novels conjured in me. All in all, though, it's decent and is worth the read if you hang in there until the planned kidnapping begins to truly unfold."

Before getting the Monster HTS 1000 I noticed some annoying picture glitches occasionally cropping up (I get a directv standard digital signal): a kind of vague line that, especially when background colors were pretty homogenous, you could follow moving up the screen; the kind of thing you could easily overlook but once you notice it, you can't help seeing it and it drives you crazy. Since running everything going into the tv through the Monster 1000, it's completely disappeared. So, this thing really does seem to deliver on what it promises: a cleaner picture."

I had taken the PC burned music Cd's out of my 2001 Camry changer when I recently traded it for a newer Lexus ES series and although they played perfectly in the Camry they skipped and cut out in the Lexus. I ran the cleaner with no improvement, but after researching further I learned that CD's created at a fast burn rate can cause this problem. I burned new ones at 4X and problem solved. I am very pleased with the Alsop cleaning disc and will use it to clean our computer drives and DVD players as they need attention also."

Since there wasn't supposed to be refined sugar in these, I thought it might work. All of them have 16g of sugar, except the dark chocolate berry bar, which has 17g. Looking at the ingredients, just about everything provides some sugar, even if it isn't refined sugar. Lots of fruit, which I expected, but is agave nectar really needed as an ingredient for all of them? Some have it for the second ingredient. After a quick internet search, I found this statement, with lots of information to back it up: ""Agave nectar is bad for you. It's not traditional, not natural, highly refined, and contains more concentrated fructose than high fructose corn syrup."" The bars all have 190 or 200 calories, and 1.7oz in weight. Lots of calories for little volume. They all have 6g of protein. I'm going to keep looking."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","The question of Alexandra's settled In a previous DS book (Dark Shadows Companion: 25th Anniversary Collection) conflicting ages for Dark Shadows beauty Alexandra Moltke are given. One page of that book says she was born in 1945 and then it goes on to say how she was 19 (!) in 1966! I wondered for a long time how old the beauty honestly was. This new book seemingly answers my question as there are a couple of pages in the book that are Alexandra's own words and she claims she was 19 on Dark Shadows, which premiered in June 1966, so I guess that makes the beauty born in 1946 (or 1947) and not in 1945, as the old DS book said. If I got nothing else out of this book I at least got the satisfaction of learning Alexandra Moltke's true age.PS I trust this book on her age over the old one because, again, we have her testimony on how old she is and the part in the old book on her age was written by someone else!"

It does not give procedures or even discuss the import aspects of hotel operation. It is missing the real world application of managment concepts.

Also, there are many glaring spelling errors and a slight continuity problem: A title will say ""see altertnate title"", and that title and review would not be in the book!

I also found myself questioning her adoption of a child.

The only saving grace is the lovely Nova-... character, who gets plenty of camera time. Mark Whalberg does his best, but he's a little better than this. Try him in Boogie Nights. I'm not comparing this to the original, it's apples and oranges. There is no sweep or spectacle in this, it's all very stagey and wooden, and predictable.

Unfortunately, the new wave DOES NOT have controls on the unit itself. Instead, one is forced to use a remote to manage functions. For parents, the cluttered or the absent minded, forget it. My kids would eat the remote for breakfast, and I'd end up with another piece of useless plastic. For my son, I just purchased a Tivoli instead. Both Tivoli and Boston Acoustics produce a fine product that doesn't require a remote. I don't think that Tivoli or BA produce the same sound quality, but what good is great sound if you can't access it? Whoever made the choice to 86 built in controls is a fool or an obsessive compulsive. Did they even bother to test this silly idea with their demographic?"

This book is a great assess as I continue to search for new healthy ways to prepare meals. The recipes are high protein, low in fat, low cal, and no sugar. All I can say is YUMMY!!! I highly recommend this book."

The book is super for eye-hand coordination, and small motor control. The cardboard construction is pretty indestructible. The cover is adorable and easily recognized by a toddler as a box of Cheerios, and the pictures are age appropriate and very colorful. This book is very creative. I wish I had thought of it myself."

It's also an excellent book to give to those who are open to afterlife discussions and/or are grieving the loss of a loved one. I also highly recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Wisdom"" by Taro Gold."

His approach makes a lot of sense.Unfortunately, there is no natural alternative ""magic bullet"". So don't expect to find any natural alternative even close to statins in effectiveness. He does weed out a couple of ineffective natural alternatives."

This is a slightly different kind of trivia book in that it is not just a ""question and answer"" book. It provides some text to go along with individual topics, and also, unfortuantely, an apparent political agenda. The author eveidently finds it necessary to intersperse some of his 60's-esque politcal and anti-Christian religious views into the book. It seems like a book written by a stereotypical Hollywood insider.That said, the actual trivia in the book is not too bad. The reader gets the chance to learn some things that someone who is not an aged hippie would not otherwise know."

They haven't fallen out since. The sound quality is great and they work perfectly. There is a jack you can buy so that you can use regular headphones instead but I like these because you can take a call without swapping out or battling with the cord. Overall it's a good product if you can't afford a $100 bluetooth headset.

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","So many more uses! While I do have the ice cream maker, I ordered an additional freezer bowl to have on hand. It is helpful if you want to make two flavors of ice cream, or if you want to cool the warm custard for vanilla ice cream before you freeze it.I have also used this container to quickly cool items (like Jello which must be cooled for a mousse, raspberry mousse comes to mind :) in a metal bowl. Place any metal bowl on the top of this container. It will be stable and the bowl will get ice cold. The contents will then cool very quickly.Try this bowl to cool down custard when you are filling pastries. Just pour in the custard and stir with a spatula for a few minutes. Soon, you have creamy, cold custard to fill those pastries.I recommend keeping one of these in the freezer at all times. There are just so many more uses! Use it everytime you need to cool a liquid quickly. You will love the results.~The Rebecca Review"

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Not quite up to others More of a 2 1/2I enjoyed this book, but did not think it was up to the previous in the series. The main problem was that it was disjointed in its plotting and pace. It felt like they had the basic book together and then created a separate plot line (or two) and wedged it in there. It broke up the main story and created a lack of cohesion that was bothersome. Sherman and Cragg have pulled off parallel plots before with great success, so I know they can do it. They just seemed all over the place in this one.(Minor spoiler alert)This is also the first book where the major campaign was not completed. I'm not adverse to cliffhangers per se, but there wasn't really any true build up and the termination seemed arbitrary.I still loved the characters and the writing itself is as exciting as usual. I hope these fine authors can get back on a more cohesive track with the next volume."

""Millenium"" is the jaded RW...but he still has enough humor left for a little tongue in cheek.""Regrets,"" ""Strong"" and ""Killing Me"" are all classics in my book.

Yes, most of the acting in the movie is below average. However, the movie is definitely worth watching because of John Phillip Law's performance.

A must see for John Phillip Law fans!"

There is some blood and violence but besides that its a very good movie. When I first saw it it was one of my favorite movies. In the opening there's an old lady telling a story to her (was it grand daughter?) - and the story was acully about her and Edward Scissor Hands. The makeup he wears looks so odd and also the hands already look odd. And the reason why he's alone and has no real hands is because his creator died right before he could finish him.

Having read the book, one wonders whether the author can actually believe what she has written, since it seems to be contrary to known facts. One will have to await for more honest books for an answer to the question: Was Mapes, Rather, et al so anxious to put on a story that would embaress a sitting President that they so clearly loathed that they ignored the question of the forged documents upon which their story was based? Or did they know that the documents were forged, but put on the story anway?"

Based upon recommendations, I actually bought the soundtrack to ""Camp"" before seeing the movie. And because I did that, I can strongly recommend the soundtrack - and cannot particularly recommend the film because, oddly, the kids in the film are at their best when they're singing.""Here's Where I Stand,"" the power ballad performed by Tiffany Taylor and written specifically for the film, is an excellent and moving piece of music. Also good are the opening track ""How Shall I See You Through My Tears, ""For the Want of a Nail"" and the Sondheim booze-induced and sarcastic piece called ""The Ladies Who Lunch.""As for Victoria Williams song ""Century Plant,"" it's a bit different (particularly in an album filled with showtunes), but it fits, however oddly. It's fun to hear over and over.I was less impressed by Daniel Letterle's songs, particularly the bland ""I Sing for You.""All in all, it's good."

I'm a male in my mid 20's, and was given a copy of this by my mother...Granted I may not be the target audience, but I don't think I could imagine a more boring or detached central character. A selfish, judgmental and frankly meanspirited character, her instincts are more paranoid than concerned, isolationist than focused, and submissive versus empowering.Anyone who reads this and see this character as a positive female roll model would be happiest watching Leave it to Beaver reruns and spend the rest of the time daydreaming about a husband.Overall, a disinteresting and predicable story with the irrelevant values of a age long gone. At best, it's cute. At worst, it's attempting to advocate a worldview that thankfully has gone the way of the bridal dowry."

The one that came with the Zen will do the job fine, but don't kid yourself that you are getting a whole second set. Seems like a bit too much to charge without coming with all the cables, so that kept me from giving it the whole 5 stars.Other than that warning, it works very nicely just as advertised. To set it up the first time, just plug one cable into a USB slot, and plug the power cord into the wall, then slide the Zen onto the cradle. Synchs up immediately and recharges MUCH faster than just doing it with the USB cable."

I now skip over that track, along with others. Fortunately, there are some good solid tracks featured. Examples follow, in order of quality entertainment; PMM,Everlast,PM5K,Korn,Creed,Zombie,Bizkit and Prodogy(many of which have a good high energy beat). The dismal performers, and ones to skip are Eminem and GnR. The final two are so-so. I received the Matrix CD with the same order, and found that it is much more intense and energetic. The Matrix, by contrast, can be played enjoyably from beginning to end."

While this is not so important if this happens in written text, it definitely is within formulas (as in density of the normal distribution on page 50, and several others), especially since not everybody will see this kind of mistake at first sight. It should have been revised once more, maybe.Still, I recommend to anyone who wants to get an overview of operational risk. But read carefully."

The writing is tendentious and florid to the point where I found it unreadable; it is something that I would expect from a 19th-century document. If this book were first published today, no respected viewer would recommend it; it's a period piece. Likewise, the omission of references is no longer acceptable.To be frank, I was unable to get more than partway through the book -- I was not prepared to slog through 1,000 pages with gritted teeth, although I gave it a fair try. This book was a deep disappointment."

It is, however, just not at all an adequate adaptation of Rosamunde Pilcher's excellent novel. The soul has been cut out of the story in order to make it fit tidily into a film. The acting and such are fine, as they go, but watching this is like watching a ghost of Pilcher's fine story, and it truly does not satisfy at all. Perhaps Pilcher's books really don't lend themselves to film adaptations. I found the adaptation of ""The Shell Seekers"" to be an appalling desecration of that book too. They should try to make them into a mini-series."

However, if you do not need a radio, I like this system. The sound is very good. Good base. Solid sound. The remote works well from across the room (20- feet or so). My only complaint is that sometimes when I put the Ipod on the unit and turn it on, the sound is at near full volume. It was at a very low level when I turned it off and removed the Ipod previously. That being said, I purchased two units, one for work and one for home and transport the Ipod between the two every day. They both get lots of use and sound great."

With so much corporatized music out there, Evanescence has defintately come up with a distinctive sound. A great combination of hard rock and dark rock. Some people may think ""Bring Me To Life"" is overplayed, but it is a song that definately gets you pumped. Thankfully, Evanescense is not like so many other bands who seem to put all their effort into one great song and turn out 8 or 9 others for the album that lack any power. ""My Immortal"" shows a softer side to the band. ""Tourniquet"" is really freaky, but I love the guitar and the overall feel of the song. ""Everybody's Fool"" has terrific energy. Along with some solid musicians, Amy Lee has a dynamite voice. The best way to describe it is think of Patti Smythe of Scandal fame, only an octave higher.If Evanescence doesn't drastically change their sound, they should be around for a long, long time."

I used it for a couple days when the latch on the pop-up lid feature would not catch. I had my husband return the item and get a replacement. The latch on the second one would not work either. There appears to be some type of design flaw. The other reviewers are correct that when you open the entire lid, the condensation from the moisture leaks out of the warmer. While this is a good concept, the design needs work. Also, my baby does not seem to mind cold wipes. I think she has become accustomed to them since that's what we have primarily used. I will probably return the second one also since it won't work properly and get something more useful."

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","this is the definitive book on this subject!!! This is a book I've been waiting for!! My wife and I have always found that our best ""dinner"" parties are the ones were we serve a variety of finger foods rather than one big entree. This book will give us ideas for years to come!! I must say that I think the best part of the book is its lay-out. You first get to see what the foods look like and then if you want the receipe, the page number is printed next to the picture. I wish all cookbook authors would use this visual approach to their receipes. I felt the the receipes were easily within the reach of the average cook and the explanations and tips on preparation were wonderful. All in all this is a book I will not only treasure but I will use again and again!!!!!"

But there is important information either omitted or glossed over, like the fact that Pete Best was asked to replace Ringo in The Hurricanes. The author has trouble with irregular verbs such as ""ring"" and ""run"", which does not command a great deal of respect. Nor could I do anything but cringe when he described the Beatles' visiting that famous old prostitute, Madam Tussaud, to see themselves in wax. Really: A famous professional writer, with book deals, and steady paying gigs, doesn't know the difference between ""madam"" and ""madame""."

Now in order to listen to them I have to hold the headset plug in the ipod without fully plugging it in, in order to get any decent sound! Obviosuly I can't sit here and hold the Ipod at an angle in order for the headphones to work.Do yourself a favor and go with another brand that isn't almost as much money as the Ipod itself!

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Another rebuttal..... I also have to challenge the previous reviewer who very obviously has maybe caught only a few episodes of RR's 30 minute meal show. Her recipes are easy and focus on fresh and healthy ingredients. With even a bit more creativity you can ""health"" up her recipes even more if you feel the need to do that. I watch religiously every day and I can reassure you that she doesn't use tortillas and taco shells frequently. It's quite the opposite. I'm amazed by the wide array of flavor combinations that she continually comes up with.My only thing -- you don't really need the book. Tape the show, and download the recipes (which are all available of the website) and make your own book of your favorites.Bottom line -- Great recipes for people who want good healthy food fast."

This is a good introduction to Deborah Gibson's music, and it contains her most famous songs _Lost In Your Eyes_, _Foolish Beat_, _Only In My Dreams_, and _Electric Youth_. But this collection does not do Gibson justice, because the current Deborah Gibson has matured into a comfortable and self-knowing performer and artist.

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A bit like Badlands George Lynch left Dokken, brought drummer Mick Brown with him and recruited a great singer by the name of Oni Logan and Anthony Esposito (bass) to form his own band - Lynch Mob. In 1990 came the first album and it's obvious that Lynch wanted to break free from the radio friendly pop metal direction of Dokken since this effort is loud and heavy but still rather melodic. The opening groovy and heavy ""Wicked sensation"" is just a great heavy metal song and the same goes for ""River of love"" and ""All I want"". The music reminds a bit of Badlands (featuring Ray Gillen - R.I.P and Jake E Lee), and like Badlands, Lynch Mob's material have a tendency to melt together. For the follow up album (simply titled ""Lynch Mob""), singer Logan was for some reason gone and that's a shame because that new guy wasn't of the same calibre besides the fact that on the follow up album the material was a lot weaker."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Artifacts: A Faye Longchamp Mystery Another great Kindle find! The writing skillfully unfolded the interesting plot, which I thought moved along at exactly the pace required for this book. The editing was absolutely letter-perfect, a major coup in the Kindle universe, with not so much as an abused comma anywhere. Only two things kept me from total enjoyment of Artifacts. One was the fear that Faye's technically illegal activities were going to cause her huge headaches, and not wanting to be too captivated by someone who could bend the law so easily. The other was the fear of liking Joe and Faye too much, only to be forced to witness their horrifying deaths. While the book did have its terrifying moments, the writer didn't turn it into the kind of psychological thriller that I find just too overpowering to read. I'm looking forward to reading more in the series."

Consequently, body image is a topic that always piques my interest and curiosity. This book did 2 things for me: cracked me up (I literally laughed out loud more times than I can count); and precipitated a true shift in my thinking about weight, beauty, priorities, and happiness. For me, body image will always be a struggle, always sitting there somewhere in my brain ready to act out and take me to that 'bad place.""

The author approaches his subject ""critically"" rather than with curiosity. Because of his intelligance, his education, his experiance, etc., he obviously feels that he ""knows"" what he is talking about. And, about many things, some of which are in this flawed book, this is true. But, he could have learned many things and this is the problem with the book.

It is quite interesting after all these years since 1966, when this series made its debut on the small screens in America, the sounds you hear on this album are unforgettable. You know in an instant what particular sound, whether it be action, adventure or drama the sound effect department is creating for the viewer.The final result is a unique library of brilliantly futuristic sound effects that were created by some of the best sound editors of that time. On this album are sixty-nine never to be forgotten sounds that made this series entertaining and somewhat believable, which we now find is not at all that impossible. This is not a relaxing listening CD, but the way we remember those sounds from the ""Enterprise"" during the '60s when the cast and crew were flying high and protecting this vast galaxy of ours.Total Time: 40:23 on 69 Tracks/ GNP-Crescendo - GNPD 8010 (1988)"

The drama is interesting. It's a decent cop show. And I like Tom Selleck. What pisses me off with BLUE BLOODS Season Two is the blurry picture quality. My one star review is a response to the inferior video quality of Season Two compared to Season One on DVD. Apparently CBS wants me to give up on the DVD format and convert to Blu-Ray, and is deliberately delivering DVDs to consumers with flawed video.The drama, the acting and the writing seems as good as last season, but the picture quality is so poor I'm not sure I will bother to watch the whole season.One good thing I can say is that the picture quality for NCIS Season Nine was slightly worse on DVD than BLUE BLOODS Season Two. Maybe TV studios don't care about viewers watching on the DVD format, and just want it to die already. Well, NCIS is dead to me. And if BLUE BLOODS doesn't get their video act together they will be dead to me too.@hg47"

The screws pictured above don't turn very easily. Obviously they weren't meant for taking back out. If you get them out, though, you then have to deal with the fact that the place to access the buttons is -GLUED SHUT-. So good luck getting in there.Also, I had to make a new hole in the hand straps to get it tight enough, but that may just be because I have scrawny hands.If you're looking for a cheap and affordable one to try to learn on, I'd pass on this one, even though it is a 30-button.

The ""ruins"" the title refers to are what the characters themselves ultimately end up becoming. These people (who can be annoying, but who can't?) are put in a horrible, impossible situation and end up becoming the victim of a relentless, unbelievably cruel and malevolent being. This story really is an essay on what people will do when facing their ultimate doom, and how far they will go to survive.If you are not a fan of gore, psychological torture, self mutilation or improptu medical prodedures described in graphic detail, then stay away.

It gave depth to the characters. I only wish there were more details about Cole and Diana's deepening relationship. I felt very confused with that scene in the plane. I kept wondering if I had missed something. I also felt that it ended too soon after the trial scene. I had to fill in all the blanks after I finished the book just to satisfy my curiosity.

And now, we have a homage to 80's metal in Probot. I certainly hope that with this template, Grohl is telling us to seek the previous works of those who have collaborated with him on this album. Such undeniable voices as King Diamond, Cronos, Max Calvera, need to be sought after in their respective groups (Venom, King Diamond, Sepultura- not Soulfly!). If this was Grohl's mission, hopefully he succeeds, and we all find the offerings from these excellent groups which are far better than what Probot brings us now, and Grohl is a genius.

She soon finds out that he is sharing a body with the soul of ""Demon Eyes"" Kyo. I bought this series a DVD at a time when it came out. It's a visually stunning anime. It also has very good voice acting and music. There are also a lot of cool characters that use some awesome techniques. It gets very weird at the end though. This anime does lack something that is hard to put my finger on. I think for me it would have been more interesting if there had been a little more emotion between Yuya and Kyo. The struggle he had within him and his feelings for Yuya may have made the series 5 stars for if they were explored little more. All in all this is an impressive series and it's a good buy."

The enthusiasm that Jack Schmitt displays in a live presentation is missing from this work, but if you want a thoroughly researched proposal to justify on a financial and societal basis a return to the Moon, then this book is perfect for your needs. If you want to find a convincing reason for going back to the Moon to stay, but are not as interested in all the expenditure/benefit analyses, you can skip over much of the fine points. In either case, Dr. Schmitt builds his case on one grand assumption, a reasonable one, that in due time fusion technology will supplant our present energy production methods, and lunar resources can provide precious fuels needed for fusion plants, and along the way a lot of other interesting geological and astronomical science can be performed as a permanent human presence on the Moon is set up."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","One hit not mentioned in any review..... Steve co-wrote with Greg Allman what is probably one of the most well known and best Allman Brothers songs ever - ""Melissa"", which appeared on the Eat A Peach album. He also wrote ""God Rest His Soul"", about Martin Luther King's assasination, which was recorded by Greg and Duane Allman before they formed the Allman Brothers Band. Originally pretty hard to find, the song was released on the Allmans box set, ""Dreams"", and is well worth checking out. An excellent song and perfect vehicle for Greg Allmans soulful voice. Steve may not have charted very high, but he did write some very fine tunes."

Those expecting numerous rocking songs in the vein of older classics such as Away From Me and Control etc will be bitterly disappointed, as this albums comprises of numerous bland 'rock ballads'. Next time the guys should stick at what they're good at; producing balls out Post-Grunge anthems."

You get a big glance behind the family of the TV show. A must have for all Teutul and chopper fans."

This is a charming, funny book that will make you laugh out loud, well up with tears, and gasp in shock.In fact, at times, it's a bit TOO shocking.... and the main character seems to take in all the outlandish abuse without so much as a peep of protest. That fact made this book a little hard for me to swallow, since I am hard-headed and outspoken enough that I NEVER would have put up with a fraction of what she did. I was also annoyed with the ending, and how many aspects of the storyline were not concluded very well or at all (hopefully the upcoming movie will do that better).However, as frustrating as it was to watch Nanny continually get the short end of the stick, and to not have a terribly satisfying ending, I still enjoyed this clever novel greatly!Grade: B+"

But as it turns out, there's only one audio input on the back, so you can choose just one of composite, S-Video and component. And if that weren't enough, the side input overrides the back input. So even with four supposed video inputs, to watch more than one device, you need to swap cables or an external switcher.On top of that, the users manual was only in French.

Unfortunately, The Town is not one of his better efforts.The Town is quite simply not well written or well executed. Dialog is just plain dumb, ideas and plot lines are muddled and the book is just not that scary.

Unfortunately she was punished by the hypocrisy of the same American society which, years later, became slave of Playboy culture as international symbol of female sexually-beauty ambition.

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",My thoughts! I thought this book was very appropriate. It shows how kids do not understand everything and need to learn more about the history of our country. Daniel Lofton was very informed. He had an intelligent reason for not standing to the Pledge of Allegiance. The very mature thing about Daniel Lofton was he never made anyone do what he did. He felt if they had a reason to sit than more power to them but he would never force someone to believe what he did. I wish I could have done this as a teenager in high school and even hope to be able to do that when i become an adult.

But it ain't up to par with what I expect from FF.The story might have been interesting, if not for the fact that it feels quite contrived in parts, and the author felt the need to push some politcal agendas of his.Most irritating is the fact that the protagonist is so fricking perfect and has ALL the luck. There is not ONE serious setback for him during the whole book, and he shows not ONE real weakness, whether physical/skillwise or psychological. He can do it all, knows all the right people, and the sun always shines for him. Such a hero is boring. He dies at the end, and we barely care.As a final note: the purely technical writing style is still good if not that exciting.

The battle system was a nice shot and worth the effort if it was in a different game. I only credit it so high because it's under such a great name.

They should have advance the game into more player options, such as multiplayer (even online!) to go against your opponents. A level design would be a good idea too, to challenge your opponents in passing your designed environment.But none of this is available in the game. The game is great, but not overwhelming great. Moreover, I am looking forward to the Pikmin 2 (if there is one).If you want to play Pikmin, I suggest you to rent it instead of buying it. I guaranteed you are able to finish it less than a week."

Instead I found a book too literate for the tabloid reader, not insightful enough for the demonically possessed.The book mentions names whose relevance sometimes puzzled me; and summarizes books and movie themes, as if high school freshmen were the author's primary target. It discusses the seduction of the demon, mostly through other writers' observations. Why is it that we get a better sense of Henry Miller's ""dictation"" than Eric Jong's ""seduction""? And while she could have genuinely and thoroughly discussed her affair with the former Mr. Martha Stewart to give us a deeper understanding of its effect on her writing, she fails to go beyond the surface.The touch of love may turn a man into a poet, but this zipless seduction will barely teach you the alphabet."

Luckily, they have loosened up over time, but my biggest beef is that they have basically nonexistant low-end. Some of the music I listen to is bass-heavy, and I simply can't hear tones below a certain point that are clearly audible in other headphones and speakers.I replaced a much cheaper pair of headphones that I bought almost 8 years ago, whose plastic frame just broke on me (they still worked fine), and those sounded better than these.I consider these a waste of money, because 75% of my music sounds great, but the other 25% is basically unlistenable."

If I were to go off to a Monastery where red face spots wouldn't matter then I could take this, but Proactiv has a better success rate for me.The micro-beads in the Neutrogena skin washer are too micro to really do anything for me. Also, with the Proactiv 2nd step - the reactivating toner (really meaningless name) - when used with a cotton swab, actually takes more dirt away from my face even after I've used Proactivs Face cleanser (first step) and it has better microbeads than Neutrogena.I'd say bottom line Neutrogena better than plain soap, but not a consistent winner for me.

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Composite is too blurry once you switch to S-video If you have never tried an S-video connection than you are truly missing out. Just make sure your TV has an S-Video out before you buy one though. The sharpness that you gain is immediately noticeable. Just imagine your sharpness bar being tripled(atleast) and then turning it to the max. That is about the equivalent sharpness that you gain from switching from the normal composite cables. Another secret to gain sharpness is to check to see if your TV has secret service settings. I think pretty much all do. For my Sony for example, I will press Display, 5, Volume Up, then Power and when the TV turns on I get these settings that I can change. If you know which ones control sharpness, you can turn it up a notch for some extra sharpness. This combined with an S-video cable will help you gain the most crisp image that your TV can display."

They stopped barking immediately and went to another room and sat quietly until I said 'Come.' After using it for several days the word ""stop"" became meaningful to them. Now, if I can't find the device, all I have to do is say ""stop"" and point the remote control, cell phone, or garage door opener at them and they ceased barking. I still carry it when I take them for walks, Just in case."

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Works great I got this Polar RS100 monitor to replace an older one I had used for years. My old one went crazy, saying my heart rate was 220 every time I ran past neighbor's yards which had an ""invisible"" dog fence. That threw off my recorded heart rate. This RS100 is not bothered by the ""invisible"" dog fences. Another advantage is that the included chest strap transmitter has a changeable battery. My old one was sealed. I've changed the battery on both the chest strap and wrist monitor, it's easy to do. The only problem I've experienced with this unit is if you don't wet the chest strap enough at the start of your run, it will not communicate well with the receiver (once you work up enough sweat, it works fine.) So be sure to wet it well at the start. It records one run, so I record my runs in a spreadsheet at the end. I've had this for a long time, and like it."

I never owned the vinyl edition of this collection, and I had no idea that ""With Your Love"" was longer. As to the omission of ""Bad Girls"" after ""Hot Stuff"" -- well, that does seem stupid. As is pointed out, ""No More Tears"" is available in its long version elsewhere and would be a more logical deletion since the segue from ""Hot Stuff"" to ""Bad Girls"" is classic, not to mention that both sides were, obviously back to back on the same side of the 12"" single.As to some of these other songs being easily found on used cd's, I'm not sure what that means. I know of no other cd's that contain the longer versions of ""I Feel Love"", ""Walk Away"", or ""Dim All The Lights"", and I have nearly every Donna Summer cd released as well as hundreds of various artists compilations of disco songs."

One is that if you're comparing it to many TV cartoons, it's not too bad - it's competently done, unlike most cartoons on TV today, which are disasters. The other is that, being a cartoon, it avoids the sometimes-risque humor of the real Mr. Bean shows.But beyond that there's nothing much here.

Much of this soundtrack is comprised of music inspired by the movie. For those looking for the great techno appearing during the movie, you will be disappointed with much of this soundtrack, with the exception of a few good tracks at the end. Upon reading the interesting thoughts by Soulson (above) the true state of the soundtrack is exposed, the producers wanted to make a soundtrack filled with rap songs about the movie which they thought would lead to more money in their pockets.

One satisfaction I get from buying a good concert DVD is the fact that I can play and listen to it over and over again while I'm doing my chores at home during weekends like a regular CD or help put myself to sleep at night watching it in my bedroom TV. This is not one of those DVDs. Yeah, I would probably watch this dvd one more time, just to watch and listen to Across the Universe, but that's about it. I'm actually thinking of selling my dvd already. The only other positive thing I can say about this DVD is the DTS option, hence the 2 stars.

Gwen Frostic stood out from the crowd, followed her heart, and brought joy to so many through her artistry, and, in the process, brought happiness and prosperity to herself.

A lot of name-dropping and snide remarks about people based on what I don't know. I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. It was obvious that the author had a thinly veiled dislike of the four main characters and made very subjective comments about them. There was no attempt to be objective - and I was irritated by the reader's attempt at imitating the accents of different characters - like Albert Baez, for example - and kept wondering where the author got his information.

NOTHING SERIOUS reads mostly like a a journal, or a incredibly long, often incohesive and random stream of thought. The novel is more about what and how the character Louise Levy thinks and how she experiences and interprets the world than about any particular events. In fact, the basic events of the plot are revealed pretty early, although perhaps out of sequence, and the story holds no real surprises. I was only so interested in Justine/Louise's mania, (though I was relieved when she seemed to figure it all out) so it took me a while to finish the book. I put it aside often to read something more interesting. I also think that the prose of this novel just does not work as well in English. The writing style is palatable in French, and is mostly annoying in English.The story itself -- I think that it could be told just fine through an long literary essay. As it book, it just seems to belabor the point."

Now I'm forever reminded of that stuttering parrot (to-to-to-be) whenever Holmes and Watson cross their threshold. Robert Arthur created ideal, escapist reading for kids who love to read (and, believe it or not, for those who don't) when he took us to Rocky Beach, CA. This book stands as one of the very best in the long line of Three Investigator books. Three Investigator fans can only hope that the entire series is reissued! BUY THIS FOR YOUR KIDS!!!"

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Worlds better than the game controller for navigating movies I had to buy this remote after repeated complaints from my wife that she didn't know how to use the game controller to navigate through movies. Granted, it's not an overwhelming challenge with the controller, but this remote is much more convenient. First, I like not having to push a connect button as required by the controller. This remote is fast and responsive, and has great coverage from wherever I am in the room. I haven't tested it from more than 15 feet from the PS3, but within this range it works perfect.The only thing I can't figure out is why there isn't a power button on the remote. I would like to be able to turn the system off with the remote, but the button is noticeably absent. I would also like it to be backlit for use in the dark. Other than that, it's a great remote. Sleek, attractive, and full of functionality. And best of all, the wife is happy!"

I bought these thinking I was going to get the original, or at the worst, the special edition. In fact, it got even WORSE than that. He edited MORE things, totally messing up the movie. The longer I watched, the more I wanted to take out the dvd and snap it in two. I hope someday he realizes that we just want to see the original movies, not the abominations he has turned them into."

To say I was disappointed is an understatement!

An example, ""You reek of mare-stink from between your thighs..."" Puh-leez!What could have been a great book exploring the Amazon culture turned into a boring treatise on horsemanship in ancient times.

I can't believe there was an editor on this thing: it's disjointed, confused, rambling, and generally, overall, not very well done.

Just when you figure out who Niven is talking about, he abandons them and you are faced with a large band of new people. Even the main character's name keeps changing!

One problem that could arise is the amount of clearance between the juicer lid and the bottom of the cabinet or microwave when cooking the berries. I had about 2 inches of clearance.

To be honest, it's more like a historical paegent than a movie. It's beautiful to look at but it's so stiff and artificial that I think Martin Scorsese could've used puppets and gotten the same effect.If you want to watch pretty scenary and costumes Kundun will be enough.

But there is still bloody mayhem, oh yes.But they needed less machination, and more Wu.No spoiler, but something of an assurance: The third season does not end on a cliffhanger, more or less. It has a kind of finish, although the makers obviously had a Season 4 in mind when they wrapped.For those new to 'Deadwood,' I am sure others have advised to watch the series in order, from Season 1. It is not a recommendation but a requirement. And give it several episodes to adjust your senses, so that you may appreciate a remarkable television achievement."

But to tell the truth I don't, because Applegate's writing is so good that she does the one thing any writer should do,that is to take the reader out of their life and tempoarly let them into a fictional world where anything can happen.And in this case does happen.

Any song that can evoke memories of the Star Force is A-OK with me. What is most impressive about this album is the broad range of songs on the album. There is something for everyone on this album yet the songs still retain a coherency as a whole. Some records have just a few good tracks that make the album great. This album hits on all accounts. Splendid. A sonic blanket that washes over the listener and transports them to a world of sonic loveliness.

First, he takes baby to Mommy's makeup table, where baby inhales toxic talc powder into his little lungs. Then, Carl attempts to drown baby in the fish tank. Failing there, he pushes baby down the laundry chute. Since none of these sinister tactics have the desired effect, Carl decides to at least try to harden baby's arteries by providing a snack of butter and half and half. When he hears Mother's footsteps, he quickly disposes of the evidence of his depravity and puts baby back into the crib......until next time..."

I was frustrated by one hike, though, when the description of the trail was insufficient and I finally turned back. The author should use terms like ""east"" and ""south"" instead of ""by the trees"" because there were trees in every which direction! It seemed at times that he was so familiar with the trails that he assumed too much instead of looking at it from the eyes of someone new to the area. It was good for organization of the trails and for helping me to figure out which ones to consider and which to pass by based on the time of year or the weather conditions."

All of this is really besides the point, for the heart of the book is in the prose, poetry really, that the author sets down with richness and sensuousness that is rare in a young writer. Each sentence is meant to be taken in, chewed and ingested for its own content and beauty. As it is poetry, the tale itself unfolds slowly, the facts of the story subservient to the panorama of the land and sea, and the motion of the plot secondary to the loving description of the coast where it takes place.This is a serious book, which leaves us hoping for more good literary news in future works."

Once adjusted, the tide graph will not be 100% precise, but around +/- 1.5 h, that means: I got it to the point, where if it's chart shows high tide in the interval 11:00 - 13:00, I am confident (I've double-checked it against the company tide chart calendar) that the real high tide falls always for sure between 10:00 and 13:00. I imagine one can do a better job adjusting it and making it work even with higher precision. If you go not by the chart, but by the high tide time it displays, results will be much more precise.Overall, I give it 4 stars.ENJOY!"

I'm not a Catholic, but I am a Christian and I find the vast majority of the conclusions Brown leaps to in this book laughable. Take the Last Supper analysis for instance. That is not Mary Magdalene seated next to Jesus. It is St. John painted in the same beardless effeminate manner that Da Vinci painted him in his St. John the Baptist portrait. The hand and knife belong to St. Peter who would later use a knife to cut off the guard's ear in the garden. Peter is leaning hard on his left elbow to speak to John thus projecting is left hand out.Brown might be right about one thing ""Everybody loves a conspiracy theory.""

James D. Houston in this book has converged the talents of a library pack rat with the stylistic and visionary grasp equal to any of America's contemporary novelists. This is the kind of book that should be assigned in history classes, just to turn people on to history and great writing. It goes way beyond, of course, a recounting of the Donner Party, and takes into the hearts and minds of human beings in a way that only a great novelist can. This book deserves a wide audience. It is a major piece of American fiction."

In parts I thought it brief, but then could I have handled more? and I am thankful Elie Wiesel wrote what he did as I cannot imagine it was easy. The raw honesty of Elie Wiesel is to be commended, and cherished, and I am thankful he had the strength of character to write this and share with those of us who may feel removed from those times: may we never forget and may we strive to change [but I feel such events will, horridlyy, return].

I knew there was no chance I would be able to carry a carseat, push a stroller, and push a wheelchair, so I bought this. It was nothing but a hassle. The video go-go babyz has makes it seem like you can do it one handed. Not so with the Marathon carseat. Although it is compatible, I found I had to squat down, balance the travelmate (there is no wheel lock), lift the carseat up and balance the base on the two small wedges, and then somehow fish the strap through the back of the carseat without letting the carseat slip off the one inch deep wedges. Really a pain in the arse. We didn't even bother with it on the flight home."

Juvenile definitely is not showcased enough on this album. If you can find a maxi-single with just the ""Ha!"" single and the two remixes, don't buy the album because it ain't worth it. The tracks featuring Juvenile's crew are weak at best. Their flow lacks energy and displays no finesse and their rap content is solely about how much money their making now, expensive rides and how every bi*ch is on their jock. Wack! I expected more of Juvenile's ""off-the-porch"" style of flowing but he's obviously following in Master P's footsteps by cross-promoting other rappers in his camp on his album. That was a mistake, his boys can't keep up with him. Also, Jay-Z sounded weak on the second ""Ha!"" remix - his rap style didn't match well with that wicked, fast-paced beat. I would really rate this 2.5 stars."

This is 10rs long, in 1hr parts.What the Collection does is , make fun of UFO believers, plain and simple.1st they place a UFO believer on, and he talks about his story with goofy music in the background, then they place a debunker on with serious music in the background and then they even have the narrator explains how foolish UFO believers are. To me, its not taken seriously enough. If you want to make a documentary about hating , debunking, or making fun of UFO believers then at least make that known with the title. Something like , UFO Nuts! or UFOs are fake! Or even Debunking UFOs! Lets us all know your against them before we buy it. I gave it 1 star because of the fact it wasnt taken seriously at all. I would have been ok with there view point if they did it in a serious manner and had respect for everyone in the documentary."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Good compilation CD Generally I dislike compilation pieces. I suppose they are mainly designed for someone trying to figure out whether they like classical music or not.However, the performances on this disc are better than the run-of-the-mill potpourri disk. The 'Summer' from Vivaldi's Four Seasons is powerfully played and a good performance (Orchestra di Milano, Benito Rossi, violin). Even the sadly overplayed Canon of Pachelbel is forcefully played with a lively tempo (Sinfonie Orchester Graunke Munich). The piano work on Schmann's 'Riding Piece Op. 68' is good as well (not attributed).All in all, a nice piece to play when you have non-classical music loving friends over for dinner or a social gathering. It is also a nice CD to have playing when you are just relaxing with a glass of wine.Maybe it will prompt some to go out and purchase complete works by a particular composer.Recommended."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Detergent contributed to hard water stains I used Cascade automatic dishwasher powder detergent for quite awhile. What can I say? I'm a sucker for lemon scent and a super affordable price. But I was frequently frustrated because every time I opened my dishwasher to inspect a freshly washed load, there were undissolved detergent flakes and hard water spots on my dishes. I know I am pretty thick, but I did not realize there were dishwasher detergents out there that actually removed and prevented hard water stains. When I finally made a switch to something else (Finish powerball tablets), all my hard water woes went away. Before, we had been throwing away our clear glasses about once a year because they were so milky white from mineral deposits. So maybe my new detergent is a little more expensive, but I'm saving money on buying new glasses. If you are looking for a dishwasher detergent that keeps dishes bright and sparkly and removes hard water spots, keep looking."

He loves to play pretend with animals and people. I thought this would be a step up (as far as age) from the Little People Playsets. I was so excited to give him this toy and after hour and a half of putting this together he was ready to play. After 5 minutes of play the whole thing practically fell apart. After putting it back together again its just fell apart again. I couldnt believe my eyes! This toy ended up being just a pile of plastic pieces. I ended up returining the Treehouse and taking my chances on another Playmobil set and bought the Treasure Chest. This was a better choice. Takes 5 minutes to set up and doesnt fall apart when playing with it.

I found the PAT on the DAT to be more difficult than some other prep products's sample tests would have you believe (Although, I did score well on the PAT). This book alone takes a methodical approach to finding the right answer, but also getting it fast, which was my problem. The science review sections were not as complete as some other books, but I found many of the explanations helpful in clarifying things that I had never learned well in my prereq classes, especially in the O Chem section, where the idea of using acid and base chemistry to solve problems was emphasized in a very helpful way. I would not recommend using this as your only review material, but in conjunction with TopScore Pro and my textbooks, etc., it helped me get very good scores on all sections of the DAT."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","I'm Not Sure How Brandon Has Slipped Under The Radar People might know Brandon Butler for his role in the ""midwestern emo"" (hate the term ""emo"") band Boy's Life, but it seems no one knows about his solo career (or when he was at the helm of the superb band Canyon). His first solo album is an acoustic affair of laid back alt-country-ish tunes, and it really feels like the album you'd put on while you're sitting on the porch enjoying the sunset, and a cold beer.If I were to sum up what Brandon butler in a sentence? It's like if you found someone whose vocals sounded like Tom Petty and Bob Dylan and had them jam with Neil Young. It's that good. And if you like this album, I'd recommend...highly recommend his second album ""Lucky Thumbs"" which has an electrified full band version of ""Sparks""...and is easily one of the best of 2007."

Borracho has its moments, but not enough the make it a truly great CD like the others. Previous songs like, ""Do the Sinister"", ""These Freaks are Here To Party"", and ""Why?"" had this classic combination I really miss on this new album.

She has always been #1 in my mind, therefore I have been anxious to find new CD releases of her albums.

I love the idea of having an ""uncut"" version of the songs and being able to hear Tammy, Billy, and the studio musicians conversing with one another, but all of the previously unreleased numbers were evidently mastered on a different speed machine. It's like listening to a 33 rpm record played at 45 rpm. Common Epic Records! The First Lady of Country Music deserves much more than she got out of this tribute. I've never heard of a recall on a CD, but Epic needs to remaster this one and recall and replace the entire stock with a carefully crafted tribute to Tammy. Needless to say, I am disappointed in this release. Epic, Tammy gave her all. Now it's your turn."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Depressing I honestly couldn't finish the book entirely. It started out with an intriging concept people dying in questionable circumstances, lovers meeting in secret, and a science fiction story woven in; however, it quickly turned into generic married the wrong person, children molested, horrible life content that I have grown so tired of. The narrarator was often boring and the book moved at a snails pace. If you enjoy dark books, you might enjoy this, but if you are like me and enjoy more uplifting books, this is not the book for you. I have never read Margaret Attwood before so I went into this with out any preconcieved notions, but I can't say I will probably read anything else by her."

That said, the quality of these recordings is a mixed bag at best. Some heavy hiss or tiny sound on songs that sound much better on some Ella Fitzgerald CD sets or even on the MCA Ink Spots greatest hits CDs I've heard. Don't be mislead into thinking ORIGINAL RECORDINGS REMASTERED means they did a good job remastering the songs.Still, as I said before, your not likely to find a more comprehensive set of The Ink Spots music on CD anywhere and it's great to hear all these songs, just wish the quality was as good as some of the other offerings out there."

If you have a pattern sizer on your computer, no need to worry about the task of enlarging by copier. There are so many choices, that I know I will be making more than the banner planned for my son's wedding.

The stakes were hard to hammer in and were VERY hard to remove (we even poured water on them ahead of time). We bent all 4 stakes fighting to pull them out. We used a few of the stakes that came with the tent and they were much easier to work with. We are NOT hardcore campers, so we plan to stick with the regular stakes. I am not too disappointed in the purchase since I really like the bag. I'm keeping all my stakes in it along with the mallet & stake puller. It keeps the items organized nicely!"

When I listen to the CD at home, I find myself playing a song over and over again, and it is a different song each day. The songs resonate at deeper and deeper levels as I come to know them better. I have been playing this CD constantly for several weeks now, and I feel that I am just getting to know it. It feels like it is going to be an all-time favorite."

I always said that Hilary Duff was another one of those celebrities that should just stick to making movies, a notion that was further confirmed after hearing her first two albums. And after the ""greatest hits"" album Most Wanted (contract fulfillment, perhaps?), she comes back at us with Dignity.Basically, I can see where Parkin is coming from when s/he suggested that a lot of these songs sound like they didn't make Madonna's Confessions on a Dance Floor. Many of the songs go by without being too memorable, like ""No Work, All Play"", ""Never Stop"" and the overrated ""With Love"". There are also some songs that could stand a rewrite or two, like ""Between You and Me"", ""Dreamer"" and especially ""Gypsy Woman"".Another flaw is that Hilary still isn't the greatest singer, but on songs like ""Happy"" and ""Burned"", she doesn't even sound like she's trying. While Dignity IS her best album, it's not that great, so you can do without it.Anthony Rupert"

She is bold, tenacious anddedicated the righting the wrongs in her world. Alas, this edited version from the original 1930 text is definitely watered down. Our heroine, is not as assertive as she was in the original and her character is flat. The original 1930 version is better written, adds more drama and puts you in the context of the times. It also shows the human side of Nancy that is not captured in the present version.Okay, so this is not the ""real"" Nancy Drew. Should I have my child read it? By all means. Although it lacks the depths of the orignal it is entertaining mystery literature for those under the age of nine. They will love the exploits of Nancy and their imagination will run wild. I do recommend that they read it and if at all possible the original. The contrasts of the two Nancy Drews is a mystery within itself."

This book was not exciting and I didn't want to read the assigned pages. We know that people don't like to see a white person and a black person together. The whole book just seems cliche, like how Ellie and Jeremiah meet by ""bumping"" into each other. And then how they ""can't stop thinking about each other."" It bugs me how perfect their relationship is, even with the racial tension. I now know that I don't like love stories, especially this one.

When I began my workout on the elliptical, I noticed there was still considerable ""bounce"". I tried to make the straps shorter, but that did little to help, and the bra became uncomfortable. I decided to keep it and wear it under a bra top for my workouts. Perhaps it wasn't the appropriate bra for my figure type. I am in my mid-forties and I will leave it at that!

It seems as if she never wanted her children in the first place..just some pretty, well-behaved, charming things to show off when it didn't interfere with her ""woe, is me"" routine. This is evident in her neglect of the first born child, Vincent. I never once expected a happy ending to this drama..just some growth on Beth's part would have been satisfying and would have provided some hope that her remaining son would not be in jail within ten years.

Nothing insightful about the ""stupid person's"" state of mind, or the havoc ""stupidity"" can wreak.Parts of it are written for the ""stupid"" person as a sort of handbook or course, but that's not to be taken seriously at all.The book is a little insulting at times because it sometimes assumes that the reader is ""an idiot"".

It's a fun read, with some really good sections that justify pushing through the more awkward entries. What makes it worth picking up would be the books in the rest of the series.

However, the items that it pushes towards the back of the book appear to me to be core skills and knowledge. I am beginning to feel that I need to read the entire book before I start working on building my database rather than building it in stages while reading the book.I am also finding that key functions are missing completely from the index (and I cannot find them by looking through the book).I'm a little disappointed in this book."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","The extra disc is a nice bonus I would say they sound like a combination of Arcade Fire and Wolf Parade, with a bit of experimentation for added uniqueness. The sound is powerful and thick and quite rhythmic, some excellent drumming and guitar playing here. I am disappointed that this band is not getting the exposure that they deserve by way of radio and clubs in the U.S. This is one of those CDs that words cannot describe, you just need to listen to it to experience it. It is a very artistic album, with lots of styles in it. Many people here compare this album to their previous one, but it stands on it's own as a great album. I'd say the melodies on here are better than the ones from You Forgot It In People, and the production is a bit bigger. If you like this you may like Arcade Fire or Wolf Parade. The extra disc is a nice bonus."

There's no memorable music; no fantastic use of color; and no likeable characters. The holes in the plot are unforgiveable and the story-line is infantile. The plot twists are predictable and almost laughable. This is simply a sorry excuse for an Argento film. I just hope that He'll make-up for it on his next project."

The Two Towers had fantastic cinematography and effects, just like the first; however, it seriously deviates from the book. Now I know that a movie can't follow any book exactly and I was impressed with how 'The Fellowship of the Rings' was amazingly close to the book. But the Two Towers takes some of the most key events, characters, and relationships and totally changes them around. The first movie did not.Great action... I think parts would be hard to follow for someone who hasn't read the books. There were some serious director liberties taken in this movie... many, many more than the previous. Some major events resembled the book. Others were totally changed and made less effective. Readers of the books who liked the first movie will be seriously disappointed with this movie. Too bad. :(."

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Hitchcock Sewell is back! In The Hearse Case Scenario, Hitchcock's childhood friend, Lucy, is accused of murdering her boyfriend, nightclub owner and sleaze extraordinaire, Shrimp Martin. Hitchcock points out to the police that just because she admits to shooting him doesn't mean that she snuck into the hospital later and stabbed him. The police are not so sure. When they find a witness who saw her near the hospital at the time of the murder, Lucy is arrested. Of course, Hitchcock can't let her go to jail and proceeds to investigate. Hitchcock's snappy one liners and dashing good looks endear him to readers and his unusual profession gives him lots of opportunities to investigate murders. Fans of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series should get a kick out of Hitchcock Sewell. The first title in the series is The Hearse You Came In On and the second is Hearse Of A Different Color."

I was at OCS the same time Bruce was there...no big deal - some racial remarks but nothing I would call institutionalized discrimination. I and a Vietnamese-American graduated the same summer he was there - why weren't we dropped? Maybe because we performed to acceptable standards while Bruce did not. OCS is meant to subject candidates to mental and physical stress - if you can't hack someone calling you names - how will you take combat?? Most of my Sgt Instructors were minorities themselves - if anything I think they were glad to see that a minority was becoming an officer. I've been a Marine officer for 15 years and can only say - I think he's made himself famous at the expense of other AA Marine officers who have graduated OCS without having to file a lawsuit.Semper Fidelis

Each chapter begins with an introductory paragraph by Mr. Lamb, but otherwise the show's creator and moderator is not injected into the material, which is presented as straight text rather than in an interview format.The short chapters make it a wonderful read in all circumstances, the material is engrossing, and one finds many suggestions for further reading here.

I was able to attend a seminar with my staff four years ago with Ken Miller. We received the book as part of the program.

From the Boston Chamber Players, to the Lincoln Center Chamber Players with James Buswell, with a great apotheosis in Szell's orchestrated version, issued by the Cleveland Orchestra in a private series. As the Szell version makes slightly painfully clear, this is not easy music to play. The really harsh and noticeable horn flubs in Szell's famous brass section are proof of that in the Cleveland version. This music does not sound terribly virtuosic, but manifestly is. This helps us get what is special about this version. This version with Collins is by far and away the most virtuosic performance I have ever heard. It is really deft, and made to sound effortless. It is simply a tour de force. Wow!In the past, used CD stores would not buy these BBC cheapie CDs, and thus did not sell them, and thus many I have not heard. .

There are some gems among his silly little haikus, and I truly enjoyed the first sequence of ""Poems of the Buddhas of Old."" Most of the collection left me scratching my head.

I followed this advice and tried the unit four times before giving up. And on the last attempt I only juiced carrots. It would invariably begin to vibrate soon after I began juicing. The most I managed was six carrots before it began to vibrate, which is caused when the basket no longer spins level due to uneven pulp distribution.

I liked the book mostly because it was a continuation of The Matrix of Destiny books, but it was very unoriginal, and I felt cheated after I read both Hearts Lair and Mine to Take back to back.

It'll leave you wanting more -- so get Moonburn, too.Jon does a version of ""Big Chief"" that's better than any Professor Longhair version I've ever heard (and I've probably heard most of them).It's hard to pick a favorite, but ""Go Ahead Baby"", written by Cleary, is flawless. I don't think there's a girl anywhere who wouldn't love a guy who says ""Anything you want, you just let me know baby"". It's raunchy in such a charming way, with one of the best lyrics -- ""I'm just waiting for a girl like you. She likes to do what you think of, don't like to think what you do"".""Burnt Mouth Boogie"" -- You've never heard fingers fly so fast over a keyboard and sound so effortless.All I can say is thank God for CDs, because if this album were on vinyl, I'd be on my third or fourth one by now.

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","I agree with the viewer from San Jose I would award this film one star were it not for the strong performances by Streep and Eastwood. However, there is the inescapable fact that this movie is a syrupy toast to the ""wonders"" of adultery. Of course adulterous affairs are potentially more romantic than committed relationships: they are generally shorter, more like courtship and less like the sometimes grind of the daily round, and -- most importantly -- novel. Now, I cannot speak from experience on that; and I hope I never will. But finally, as painful as much of this movie is, the book is ten times worse. That man simply cannot write (e.g. ""he was a strange stranger""); I am ashamed for us all that it ever topped the bestseller lists.

I tried the Little Oaties cookies recipe; it lists 8 ingredients, but only tells you what to do with 5 of them in the instructions. I've ended up inventing my own recipe over time (not the author's intention, I imagine!). Other recipes are similarly confusing. We had to make three versions of the Banana Bread recipe before it actually worked.My other criticism is that different variations of recipes are listed as separate recipes (e.g., Citrus Orange Cake & Toasted Coconut Pecan Cake). When you only have to substitute one or two ingredients, I think it's a variation and can be listed as a note in the same recipe. In another cookbook, these recipes wouldn't add up to 140."

In short, I think she should have focused on the job; it was hilarious to read about the world of high fashion and the people who inhabit it--but there was too much focus on the main character's personal life and motivations.

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Not a true fit I purchased the black jeans along with two other pair (of different colors). You would think that they would all fit (about) the same. The black jeans were cut completely differently than the other jeans even though they were all supposedly ""550""'s. WIth the hassle of having to ship them back, we just kept them. For us, paying more on Amazon (than our local store) and then having to ship to return wasn't ideal. I think that this experience has made us rethink buying clothes online - convenient to order but, if not perfect, then you have to ship them back. As long as you know this and accept it then it is okay."

Porsche 320gb external hard drive for under $100. I plugged it in, the usb cord was included, and it came up just fine on my computer. My only problem came when I actually tried to use the back-up software included. The software isn't worth the disc it was burned onto. It kept telling me I didn't have enough room on the hard drive to back-up. Considering the Lacie hard drive is 4 times larger than my computer's hard drive that was not even an option. I reformatted to see if it just wasn't recognizing the space and that didn't help either. I gave up on the software, backed up through Sonic and had no problem.I would buy the hard drive again and definitely recommend it to others (especially if you get the under $100 deal), but don't bother unpacking the software."

The first part reads like a badly writtem romance novel. The rest is so mindless I can't see how it can be compared to being anything like Harry Potter. The writing is insultingly childish and the characters appear stereotyped.(one of the ocean charaters talks like he is from New York). I couldn't find any redeeming qualities in this book.

The story flows effortlessly and sometimes uncomfortably into familiar life situations from McMillian, PA to Madacasgar. The characters are drawn convincingly and it easy to insert yourself into the shortcomings and solutions the characters face. If you read only the Prologue, you'll have a terrific read, but continue into this tale of passions and persuasions. Cherish the history and hope for a sequel."

I had to reread the last 50 pages to see if I missed anything... it gives vague ideas of what could have happened. It ended up being a wanna-be suspense book.The drama of the book is chaotic at times but I would still give it 2 stars only because I couldnt put it down the last 150 pages or so... dont let me convince you of that being its redemption.."

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Very charming and thorough book. This was the first book I got from American Girl when I was little, and I really enjoyed it and remember being quite impressed with it even back then. The illustrations are cute, and the texts/lectures are quite useful. The author tries to convey lessons in different ways and in a manner in which girls would be more receptive to them, including through quizzes and games, all of which are all good common sense. Topics covered include everyday manners, greeting people, hanging out with friends, using good manners in public, staying polite but firm in your personal safety, eating at fancy restaurants, etc. The tone is not the least bit condescending, but personable, like many of the American Girl books, I would later come to discover. There is a newer edition to this book (A SMART GIRL'S GUIDE TO MANNERS), but the text is all the same excepting an addition about online safety and ""Netiquette"" (with Instant Messaging and emails, etc.)."
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Ignoring the data, and the truth When Duesberg first began to talk about AIDS he was correct in saying that Koch's postulates had not been fulfilled. Some 20 years later both Koch's postulates and Bradford Hill's criteria for causation have been fulfilled, meaning it has been proven that HIV causes AIDS, according to established medical principles.What's astonishing about Duesberg is that he continues to pretend that this data, and data from hundreds of related articles, simply does not exist. That's what we see in his talks and his writing: if you just ignore the published research, and selectively focus on the smaller, unresolved details, you can convince any gullible or predisposed person that established fact is false."

The picture of book and read were similar but not distinct enough. The bathtime section, when is a toilet part of bathtime? Who has a rainbow rubber ducky?? Their rattle was the worst rattle I have ever seen. Soft toy, when in that part of a baby's vocabulary? They picked a guinea pig as one of their pets?

However, when it was first released the thing that everybody noticed was that Jim Capaldi co wrote and played on the album along with Reebop and co produced by Chris Blackwell(all of Traffic fame). So it was more than a little surprising to find nothing sounding like Traffic. Hold On goes nowhere and Time Is Running Out is way to disco. However, what Steve Winwood album doesn't have something good to offer? On this one it's Midland Maniac and Let Me Make Something In Your Life but the rest doesn't really go anywhere."

It was just too, too....oh, I don't know.... self-congratulatory, unbelievable, or something. ""Look at what a cute little book I wrote about a bunch of women with cute little Ya-Ya names"". Maybe because I'm not from the South but it seemed like the author was trying way too hard to be oh-so-clever. Didn't work for me - made me cringe. But as you can see other people liked it. Or maybe that means it was a good book because it DID invoke feelings in me (even though they were hateful feelings).

I decided I had much better things to do with my time (consider that I recently got laid off from my job - so my time if pretty clear - doesn't that tell you something?)

It not only explains the state of enlightenment and the process involved, but also explains how we can approach this state. This book is easy to understand and a pleasure to read. As Toru Sato convincingly shows us in his book, ""The Ever-Transcending Spirit"" it is impossible to reach a state of enlightenment while we are ""trying"" to become enlightened. However this book still eloquently shows us that living in the moment is the essence of enlightenment and what that really means. If you are ready for this next step, the ideas in this book will resonate in your heart. If you are interested in enlightenment, definitely read these books!"

First of all, 2 of his songs are from previous albums, and his tracks have a flavor not at all consistent or characteristic of a Nickatina cd. This newest cd was quite upsetting. Only half of the songs are actually good, and only a few of those songs( ""Fly like a bird"", ""Train with no love"", and ""Dice of life"") attempt to recapture the unique flavor Nickatina at one time effortlessly maintained. IF YOU ARE A NUBEE TO DRE DOG, YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD. IF YOU ARE A TRUE FAN YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED, BUT WON'T REGRET OWNING IT."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Great Album! While the voice, at some points, is a little bit abrasive and annoying, the musical talent exhibited by these youths is certainly evident. I must disagree that the lyrics are ""juvenille""; just because a 12-year-old refuses to conform to the norms of love songs does not mean his words lack complexity or wit. Each song on the album is catchy and has a cool riff, and Newsted is a great addition on the bass. I must add that each song is in a different key, possibly in the style of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier. Thus, the album has great replay value, due to the non-tedious nature of the keys.I heart the Moss Bros, and sincerely hope they get back together soon. I wonder how Reuben is doing. He must be in his junior year of high school by now? Wow, crazy how this generation grows up so fast!"

Having to pull over every 30 mins to readjust to a new ""station"" for the signal conflict is a pain.Although it has a good number of stations you are supposed to be able to tune it to, I found this to be spotty at best.

As this was under $40 it is not worth the hassle and I am sure this is what the seller counts on. So in conclusion..

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Apologies to The Virginian. This is a depressing western novel in which the main character robs a bank, kills some innocent people, kills some bad people and falls in love with a woman who is not exactly one of the upright ladies of the old west. None of the people in this book have any redeeming qualities except the Indians and the posse chasing the main character, Tom. This is little more than Bonnie and Clyde on horse back. The writing was okay and the plot did have me engaged, but I kept hoping the ""hero"" would get caught by the posse and strung up from a high limb of the nearest tree. The point of the story is that we should feel sympathy for him. I didn't. It would have been an interesting story if the marshall chasing this guy would have been the main character. Some of the characterizations are well drawn, but most were people I wouldn't want to hang around-even in a book. I must add that I like westerns and edgy characters, but this was not worth my time or yours."

It may have been ten years ago that I saw that poll. Since that time, I've seen all the movies in the Evil Dead series and am now a big Bruce Campbell fan. Bruce Campbell is all that's great about B-movie actors. He's a charismatic ham, aware that he's not the greatest actor in the world so he's just having a good time. You could say the same things about Chuck Norris, the Rock, or any number of action stars, but what Campbell has and they lack is his Looney Tunes sensibility. He looks like a man's man, but he's a goof at heart. He makes his directorial debut with Man with the Screaming Brain (2005) and keys into exactly those qualities fans want in a Bruce Campbell feature. The movie is manic Saturday afternoon sci-fi. It runs along smoothly until an end-of-the-movie chase scene that seems a little tacked on."

Adapted Screenplay (from the original play), Costume Design, Original Music Score, Best Picture, and Best Actor are all potential winning categories for this gem of a movie (although I do like Sideways for Best Picture and Jamie Foxx for Best Actor, however).I vehemently feel that Kate Winslet was slighted by The Academy Awards after not being nominated for her amazingly mesmerizing performance as the widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies. She was, in my opinion, even better than she was in her nominated role from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In any event, Finding Neverland is anything but devoid of sublime acting from all involved. Depp is equally impressive as enigmatic playwright J.M. Barrie. All in all, one of the year's best -- period."

I reported this to Skil assuming that they would stand by their product and have some decent customer service.

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Lots of Quotes - Not Much Else One would think that writing a ""book"" would require an author to make sure that their work contained a lot of their own writing. Not the case with Mark Levin. He has determined that the best way to write a book is to contain paragraph length (or longer) quotes and then to put forth a couple of lines of his own text to say that it proves his point. His ""Biographies"" of the fifteen justices are particularly poor. Not only for their content (or lack thereof by the author) but because they are not truly representative of the history of the court.Overall, I would say that this book is lacking in a host of areas and that most people could actually do a better job researching this position than Mark Levin. The actual writing of Mark Levin is generally weak and not well reasoned. One would be better served reading the actual books and papers quoted by Levin than this book."

I liked this book, but I did not like the amount of rhetoric I had to weed through in order to get to the actual point. The philosophical muddiness of this novel became oppressive, especially Roark's massive speech at the end. It was difficult, because it requires you to pay attention, not out of interest, but because a massive argument is being put together, and it would be very frustrating if you got all the way through it and missed the point. I just feel that she could have made the point of the novel with less pages and more interesting fiction. My biggest complaint about Ayn Rand is she does not ever seem to clearly state that her philosophy is designed to further yourself, but not by screwing your buddy over, and, as a result, too many people use it to justify these ends.

At most it helped me answer about 5 questions of the 71 on the Exam. The exam questsions were just very different from what was in this book. I also read a different 70-175 prep book, and the other one I used was of little use as well."

This dvd set has only a handful of matches in full (which is pretty bad considering the caliber of talent that is featured). The only matches that I sat through and enjoyed were the Magnum T.A.- Tully Blanchard, Snuka-Muraco, and Bret-Owen. I wasnt to crazy about the Rhodes-Flair match though. Anyway, they could have thrown in some War Games matches from the NWA/WCW era. I believe those matches would have made the dvd's worth buying. I'm gonna end up trading it in for The Ric Flair Collection. Thanks!"

I'm not going to ruin some of the surprises, and there are many of them. But number 12 Grimmauld Place (Where Harry stays after leaving the Dursleys), is a very interesting place. And best of all is Petunia and Vernon Dursley asking Harry about the Wizarding World! You'll just have to read it to find out more about that.

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","The Real Deal Margaret Frazer has done it again. In this story of two young boys, half-brothers to the underaged King of England, she blends her profound knowledge of the history and theology of late medieval England with a satisfying plot to keep the more sophisticated reader entranced. There are echoes of 'real' history--the princes in the tower--and lots of details that bring the characters and times to life. Above all, Frevisse is fully developed as a 15th century Benedictine nun--her theology is accurate and if her Latin is a bit shaky, we'd never know.I'm tired of all the superficial 'medieval' mysteries that are just modern stories with a few knights sprinkled around--Frazer knows her stuff. This heroine recites her Hours, but thinks about her God as the granddaughter of Geoffrey Chaucer would have. I have most of the series and will try to find the rest, for sure."

I choose the former, and wish to counter the charge that including a variety of popular artists on the album amounts to ""selling out"". On the contrary, I bought the album after hearing ""Corazon Espinado"" (a solid, addictive joint effort with Mana) on Argentine radio, oblivious to the fact that ""Smooth"" was all the rage back in the U.S. A work that has a little something for everyone should be heralded, not dismissed. Moreover, if it is a certain style or continuity in the album that you crave, you need only to sit back and enjoy Santana's incomparable guitar solos. The work merits all the accolades it has received."

The plastic part to attach would not accept the screw. I am 6'4 and 200 pounds. I had to put all of my strength and weight Into it to get this done.A later step rewires you to insert two small screws into vertical canals to affix the part. The canals were too small for the very common multiple screw head driver I use. I had to buy a skinny Phillips head screwdriver to do this step.This is ridiculous.

Why does Berg insist on her lead female characters being so stupid? It is very frustrating for me. They appear to be very helpless, no self-esteem and are waiting for the man to save them. What kind of crap is this?! It drives me crazy because parts of the book caused me to say, ""That's just how I feel"", and then turn around and have the character say and do the most stupid things. This is a fast and easy read, and there are some thought-provoking ideas in the book, but I must warn you that you may end up very frustrated!"

But for Coleman products, the Quick Pump is perfect."

I mean, it was instantaneous - from sitting on the ball to sitting (somewhat painfully) on the floor. Maybe I should proactively replace these things after 11 or 12 months?"
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Received different model, not the one in the picture What's the point of offering a product WITH a picture, if the item actually being sold is a different one? The reason I took the time to go on-line and buy this product for my son at Amazon and WAIT for it, was because the Cars version they have at my local Target (or any store for that matter) is one I had already purchased. I wanted a different one, and this one looked pretty nice, nice colors. BUT, I received the one I ALREADY had, which is dull, maroon and grey... Very disappointed."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Good, solid documentary. Pretty good documentary about 3 different women making effective changes in the lives of their community members. This documentary was realistic, and gave a good view of what goals the women are trying to achieve.In the midst of poverty, the 3 women seem optimistic about bettering their communities. A HIV-positive woman in Vietnam seeks to educate others about HIV prevention and prevent the spread of HIV. An educated woman in the poverty-stricken country of Mali has established a foundation to educate migrant girls and help them obtain job skills. And a woman in Bosnia seeks to establish a women's agricultural coop to economically benefit her community as well as bring together different ethnicities.The documentary was more informative than emotional or heartfelt. I didn't feel my heartstrings being tugged, but the documentary did leave me with a sense of feeling inspired, and optimistic towards mankind."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Another ensemble failure with occasional good episodes Grey's Anatomy had some stand out episodes in this season, with ""From a Whisper to a Scream"" and ""Some Kind of Miracle"". Unfortunately, while the writers were crafting these superb episodes, they apparently decided to wait to the last minute to write practically the rest of the season.Story arcs seem to drag on forever, like someone realized they needed nine episodes and decided to pad out three. Also, it always seems that with a large cast, you're always wanting the focus to be on certain characters and all that happens is that the focus is on the other ones. Sometimes Christina's mind games with Burke could get to be a little too much and all the time I'm wondering ""What about everyone else?""And don't even get me started on the ""finding a new chief"" plot. Just more filler."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","OK This was a ok book first time reading anything by Kiki Swinson. Good story line that tells about Kira the wifey to a big time well known drug dealer name Ricky. They been married for 7 years and Kira been dealing with him sleeping around having babies after babies with other women but, Kira sticks around until she can't handle it no more. Her cousin gets locked up for helping Ricky with his dope runs. Kira helps to give information about Ricky so he can get locked up. Kira falls for one of Rickys guys name Russ that sets Kira up and takes all of Ricky's and Kira money.This book puts you in the mind of the wifey to a drug dealer take you to the other side instead of us always following the drug dealer. But, in away wishing it had more action involved tell you the truth. Also noticed a lot of misspelled words hoping it wasn't just my book give it a 3 because I think it was ok not bad but, ok. Hoping the other sequels is a little bit better.Now ready to read I'm Still Wifey. :)"

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Lackluster third entry Although Tecmo outdid themselves in terms of beautiful graphics and stunningly horrifying spirits, I found the storyline confusing and not all that engrossing.I liked the return of Miko Hinasaki, heroine of the original Fatal Frame, (she's not the main character, but the assistant to the protagonist, Rei Kurosawa, but you can play as her for a while), and how this entry tries to tie all three games together, but I think it fell short of succeeding.The opening tutorial was rather annoying, as you are equipped with a standard camera that cannot harm spirits, leaving you forced to run whenever they attack, which is often enough to adversely effect your game health. The new controls aren't as easy as the first or second entry, but I suppose you can fix that yourself.This entry mildly repeats themes and spirits from the first and second game, and adds ones that make this entry truely scary.Overall, a somewhat disappointing entry in the series, but not terrible. Mildly entertaining."

Why do so many books meant to ""inspire"" teachers end up sounding the same? And why do so many of them take 150 pages to convey information that, at best, might be the basis of an article? Intrator's book is one of these; you'll find yourself skimming after the first fifty pages. One of the arguments of the book is the importance of engaging students in their study of literature by connecting it to their own lives. Another is the importance of treating students with respect and acknowledging their ideas. Kind of obvious, huh? If you need this book, get it used."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Too much like synth pop if you are looking for traditional qawwali by the great Abida Parveen, this is NOT the one for you.

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Not very good. This is not a very good item. First the problem is the range.

It also worked less than a quarter mile away from our apartment. Range is disappointing. The second problem is that both of our messengers would at random upon turning on forget our ""buddy list"", making it impossible to send a message to a sleeping unit. Makes the whole thing useless. Overall this product could've been really cool, but it felt like they gave about 63% of possible effort into making it."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Not quite good enough Initially ""Saga Frontier"" is quite interesting, but unfortunately it quickly bogs down from there. The game offers seven different characters in seven different stories (some of which are actually quite interesting); this is a very neat idea, but the action gets repetitive after exploring the same area in different stories. The fight action is interesting at first, but this too gets repetitive in a rather short time. One thing I did like was the backgrounds; some of them were just beautifully rendered. Unfortunately the character/monster graphics just did not fit in with the background; they were two different styles that just did not mesh well with each other. If the game had offered a better combat engine and more unique areas for each character, ""Saga Frontier"" would have been a pretty good game."

And who in their right mind would give up the son of a famous racehorse? I mean, Ashleigh had to fight just too keep Wonder's foals at Whitebrook and she just lets her daughter give Legacy up (the word stupid comes to mind.)

I have made a bunch of shop-made inserts myself (1/2 inch Baltic birch with self-tapping machine screws to adjust the height).

The whole picture is too grainy too.Heather and her sister sit in Marks and Spencer pyama's, weeping and crying; who's the nicest sisters.Later on there's a special interest of one Lisa Dergan who looks better on pictures than acting in some kind of golf game.

HOWEVER, if you are looking for that thick & soft plushy feel of a luxury resort cotton towel don't buy this one. The microfibers are so effective that the towel clings to my body and requires some effort to move without bunching up. I also like how fast this towel dries after use, as well as after machine washing, and does not become smelly after two or three showers.

The receiver device was easy as well.Took me a moment to coordinate the volume control on the computer with the volume control on the Logitech receiver and the volume control on their stereo -- so there wouldn't be a dramatic volume change switching from the Logitech input to others.Mom was thrilled.Then it just quit.

Not exactly what I was hoping to teach him. Perhaps he is just at that age where he really doesn't know what he is feeling and just likes to say things for effect - I was just hoping for a better message in the book, not that his plans for running away after being ""so mad"" were foiled because he wanted to go play with his friends.

So when I finally had a few days off work and sat with several books written by my favorite authors I did not expect the kind of story depicted in Isle of Dogs.

This all seems to be so artificial and superficial. Her voice is also not nice anymore, it's a screaming around (maybe she should drink more tea)."

The drives are faster than any other flash USB drive I have used. They work well on OS X and windows, transferring files from one platform from the other without incident.I only spotted two flaws. As with many of these drives, the cap is very easily lost. The memorex drive has a nice cover but are relatively slow. The Memorex is a good design but not so fast.The other flaw is it simply unmounts itself from OS X under *extreme* use. I tried putting my mail files on the drive so I could pick up mail on any of my Macs. The database was corrupted several times when the drive suddenly dismounted itself. The manufacturer indicated that it just draws too much power under those circumstances it will fail. This problem never occurred under ordinary use."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Too loud, not interesting Based on the mostly positive feedback, I purchased this cube as a birthday present for my son's first birthday. He's not even slightly interested in the sound; my 4-year old pushed the buttons a few times, but complains that it's much too loud - unfortunately you can't control the volume. It really is too loud. The 1-year old pushed the buttons twice, and got very close in order to look at the blinking light, but that's it. The sound quality is also not the greatest, but it is a children's toy, so I didn't really expect it to be any better. So, neither one of my children plays with it or is actually interested in it, and the biggest drawback is the lack of volume control, since the toy is way too loud. I'm seriously considering returning it."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Decent, but largely recycled material... This album is another in the litany of repackaged, ""greatest hits"" albums that Petra's labels have produced over the years, and this one was largely unnecessary. Several of these songs have appeared on other similar collections. And with only ten songs, this is rather unsubstantial.Nonetheless, it is Petra, so the music and lyrics are good stuff. If you want to listen to some driving worship music from the 1980's and early 1990's, this is a good place to start. I'd recommend other Petra albums before this one, but it's still a good one to have, and I listen to it often."

It was promptly replaced with a newer version which seems to be working well (again had to have it shipped to the US address and sent to me). I would have preferred to have a refund, but the seller did not seem to be too receiptive to that and really wanted to replace it with a more expensive unit. This unit now works well, but I had to have it completely reprogrammed (cost of $50.00) because even though it came with the base, it was not the master handset and could not access all of the features.

But it sucked because it ruins the whole movie. It turns it into this religious piece of crap that doesn't really make you think it just basically says that it's okay to kill a bunch of people as long as you say god told you to do it.I think I'm rambling... that is because I did like the idea behind this movie and the acting was great, there were even some really creepy scenes and a lot of tension, but the plot twist at the end ruins it all....

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Two thumbs, er claws up! Alien vs Predator 2 creates an unbelievable environment which emulates that of two of the best Sci-Fi movies, Alien and Predator. The attention to detail and the flickering lights in the dark settings really draw you in and give you an exceptional feeling of being there (especially in a dimly lit room). From what I've been able to determine from some of the game sites is this game will draw you in further with its intermingled story much like Half-Life, Half-Life: Opposing Force and Half-Life: Blue Shift did only this game has all three storys in a single install. You'll get to play the part of the Marine, Alien and Predator in a story that will certainly cross paths. The demo only allows you to play the part of the Marine, and he's neatly equipped with a knife, handgun, machine gun (a shotgun only once you find it) and a nifty hacker device. This game looks to be all its cracked up to be and a little more. I'll give this one two thumbs up and that's based on the demo. Wow."

This is the first book in an extremely popular series for kids called ""Goosebumps."" All of the stories are the scary stories that children seem to love. There are many adults who have commented on how they dislike this series. They say that the stories are usually not that great, there is little to be learned from them, and that there are so many better books to read by children in this age group. I take a slightly different stance. Any book or series of books that can get children into the habit of reading (period!) in today's world of TV and video games are great! More power to them. I find too many students today, even here at the University, who simply don't read. In this first volume, a family with two children move to a small town in which the inhabitants appear to be zombies!"

Also there were many plot points that are left undone. What happened to Leventhal? Why did Karavitch set the bomb or hijack the plane?It just felt kind of unfocused.

Even though this book was written more than twenty years ago, it is a classic in its field. There are no fancy and impractical techniques in this book. The author has experience in military close quarter combat systems, and the techniques he teaches are based upon the reality of street combat. Though I do not agree with all the techniques in this manual; nevertheless, the author does show some very effective techniques against the knife and other weapons. I do like his approach to defending against the knife by using a chair and any other objects available.In conclusion, even though the techniques are not complex, they still require a lot of practice to master.Rating: 4 Stars.

I did personally feel a few scenes where a little unecessary but hey I got what I payed for. It took me a few hours to get over the pure freakiness of the film.

I wouldn't recommend this game unless you have an older child who is patient enough to follow directions and has better fine motor skills.I think a better game for little ones would be one I bought that comes in an egg crate.

And when you can't connect the router to the internet to access OEM firmware updates for the router. So forget it. I'm sending mine back.Any Cisco-Linksys marketer reading this needs to know I consider failure to openly list known compatibility issues (in some obvious place like the box or the Amazon page) to be questionable practice. So I'm going to put Cisco-Linksys forever on the same s*** list occupied by such rising stars as Philips, Kia and Books-A-Million."

Although Coldplay take center stage when it comes to gentle rock, Travis have always offered an earthier, folkier approach to warm rock lullabies. They can be bittersweet, on ""Flowers in the Window,"" optimistic, such as on ""Sing,"" or sorrowful, on ""Why Does It Always Rain on Me."" The earlier material is a little weak, but the latter makes up for it. Here you'll find tracks about love like ""Side"" and current politics like ""The Beautiful Occupation."" Travis are an underrated band with strong melodies and, by listening to this collection, a great catalogue."

I probably won't do the beginner video again; it's not much of a workout if you're a relatively fit person. I like the specialized ones - they're short enough to be perfect supplemental workouts to your cardio. They're not enough to be a standalone workout. I love the instructors - different for each video, but all cute and peppy."

The only thing I didn't like was that some of the smaller illustrations are repeated over and over again, surely they could have drawn a few more different ones in those cases. A very good book and one of the better of this type of genre.

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","We are not helpless saplings This book in not an eyeopener. Pipher is simply stating the obvious, over and over again. It does not take a Ph.D to realize that society harms girls like myself. She also portray us to be helpless victims floundering in a misogynistic (a word she throw around too freely) culture. As a psychologist, doesn't she realize that depression cannot be blamed on the world? It is a chemical imbalance of the brain, proven to be severely intensified by changing hormones. She generalizes, stereotypes (the rich girl, the poor girl, the anorexic girl, the smart girl), and does not seem to see her clients as individuals.As a teenage girl, I was not impressed. I am not a sapling in the wind, I am something far more resilient and righteous.

When it arrived from Amazon, I skimmed through it, and had mixed feelings. The stories are wonderful to read as an adult but seem a bit dated, and, while still an enjoyable read, may be less than engaging for many children. The illustrations are fairly interpretive and rendered in black and white, so the book doesn't function as any kind of quick reference. But as a learning tool for increasing a child's acquaintance with familiar backyard birds, it's very good. Paired with a good quick-reference field guide or chart, this could make for many happy hours of satisfied bird-watching."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Not the best, not the worst I think saying this CD set is ""a piece of crap"" is a little harsh considering the description says clearly that this is a digital remix of the original soundtrack and does NOT claim to be the orchestral version conducted by John Williams. It's actually quite a nice piece of digital music considering the price: all 3 movie soundtracks for the price of 1 orchestral version. Honestly, in some places I forgot it was digital because it really sounded like orchestral quality.If you're expecting the full-orchestral-John-Williams-conducted version, then yes, you might be disappointed. Otherwise, take advantage of a surprisingly rich mix of digital music that may not be John Williams but gets the point across for a much lower price."

I was engaged by the characters and wanted to know what would happen to them. The social setting was imaginative and unique. Rusch worked in some interesting social satire, too.My reservations about the book revolve around what I think is a fatal defect in the underlying premise, that convicted criminals could escape Draconian punishments from alien races by obtaining assistance from private agencies acting outside of the law.If the aliens could obtain our sanction for seizure of convicted criminals, they would also seek conviction of those who aid them in flight. The complicent agencies would face the same Draconion punishments meted out against those they assist.Although, the story is a decent thriller, this contradiction makes for a flimsy, incredible premise."

MYSTERIOUS WAYS has to be one of their greatest songs, and the heartfelt ONE is a somber ode to the AIDS epidemic. UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD is one of the best dance tracks of the early '90s, and it is easy to see it as being a real forerunner to the trance songs we hear today. It's an excellent album, and one that should properly be put in the annals as a classic record...a real early '90s showcase."

I find that when I use this tape consistently, within three weeks, my problem areas (loose areas around my midsections, butt, and thighs) are almost non-existent. Ellen, the instructor, seems approachable and easy-going. The drummer is in no way distracting, but the music pumps you up and changes tempo with the moves in a very motivational manner (especially at the times when you need it the most!). This is a very low-impact cardio workout, but if you are looking for a strong pilates workout, I would suggest Stoutt and/or Windsor. But this tape definately gives you the cardio needed to stay in shape."

Vader's ""redemption"", Luke/Leia's sibling bond, Han/Leia's romance all seemed a bit forced and half hearted. And of course, the Ewoks didn't help.

My only complaint so far is the same as you've read here. The miter gauge has play even after I went through the prerequisite rituals of tightening anything that looked like it might tighten. I tried rigging something, and I tried facing the table toward Mecca while prostrating myself. Finally, the only thing that worked was getting online and buying a worthy replacement for the miter gauge.

Rather than being meaningless, nonsensical or ironic, the senses then become more apparent and appropriate for their intended use.The author also tends to infer a sexual aspect to just about every experience she describes, which detracts from the inherent essence of those unique experiences of smell and taste. Though all the senses undoubtedly contribute to our sexuality, this was over-emphasized and distracting."

She, unfortunately, is the only dark haired performer on this dvd.One thing I noticed was that all the models seem to have a bruice in the same place on their left buttucks. I guess they have to be innoculated to work for Peaches & Cream.As for the multi-angle feature, two are from a distance and one is up-close and personal.

I'd get into it for a few weeks then have to put it down and read something lighter for a while. It's not for the casual reader or even a casual history buff. It's jam-packed with information on every page. By the time I finished, I'd forgotten most of what's in the beginning. It's very thorough. But it doesn't flow the way a novel does. Not even close. I had to consult a dictionary many, many times. I think the reader is expected to have a pretty good knowledge of history before beginning the book and a very good knowledge of English vocabulary. I wouldn't call it entertaining as much as informative."

Afraid of love, running from marriage, Amanda sensed danger--and desire. His burning kisses seared her soul. Was this the love that promised to banish her fears at last...or a reckless passion that would bring heartache as it raged wildly out of control?"

His coach Cal has interesting stories from his basketball history that gets Lonnie even more hooked on playing his game. Lonnie and his team learn deeper meanings in the sport and their lives. One example is that even if someone have the gift and have the passion for something, that doesn't mean they will make it. It doesn't mean they will suceed. It is an intriguing story about working hard for what you deserve, or what you believe in- in this case, basketball. I recommend this book to anyone who has a love for basketball.

In fact, she married John Rolfe, not Smith.For all his complaining about being mistreated for his lack of family connections, John Smith probably was the hero he portrays himself to be. Otherwise it seems Jamestown would have failed miserably.Some of the most interesting details involve the infighting, which at times turns deadly, the treason, selfishness, and other human faults and frailties revealed in Smith's accounts.Readers will also enjoy the story of the eleven year old Pocahontas, and the ""royal"" lifestyle she enjoys as her father's favorite daughter."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Library Journal has it just right BHaBU is a very uneven collection of essays. To LJ's criticisms I would add one more -- which the author himself notes at the outset: there is an enormous amount of repetition in this already short book. To be sure, the science writing in BHaBU is, expectedly, quite interesting (hence, 3 stars). But many essays in BHaBU are little more than quasi-verbatim rehashings of other essays in the book. Overall, BHaBU feels more like a profit-seeking venture than the deliberate product of a conscientious author. And strong agreement with LJ: the last 'essay' in BHaBU -- the transcript of a radio interview -- is pure filler. Very annoying, I thought."

A bit of research will show that I edit the 'zine this novel was first serialized in, however when I finally got around to purchasing it, opening it ... reading the thing from cover to cover; rather than the quick summary I initially did - - I handed it to my eighteen year son and said, ""If you don't read this, you'll regret it later.""I'll tell you what my son said today, ""I want a sequel. That's what I regret. That there isn't a sequel.""The reader will find themselves caring about the characters who are the ""guys you see every day"". You'll hate yourself for giving a damn.And you will. Before You Were A Prophet is funny, irreverent and entertaining. Just when you think you're reading something light, it becomes heavy with a perfect amount of truth that will stun you. However, as the author says, ""None of this happened.""Or did it?"

If they puto out an ad w/ only pix and no prices I thought that would have proved their purpose alot better. Seeing footage of eldely and handicapped people trugging through a meadow to a fake place isn't exactly a funny moment. The other reviewer here is correct that this seemed to have really stirred up a whole seperate incident of commoners arguing among eachother about ""joining the EU or not"" where if you're an outsider to the scene you aren't quite sure what all the anger is about.

I had high hopes for ""Borat,"" based on numerous reviews and comments, but I was disappointed. I expected rude, crude humor, so that aspect did not bother me -- but this is basically a one-joke movie, the joke being that Borat says stupid and outrageous things to provoke stupid and outrageous responses. Which he does. Again and again. Unfortunately, after a while this wears a bit thin, and I found myself glancing repeatedly at the time display on my DVD player.Quite often my reaction was ""Oh, c'mon, this HAS to be a setup, with the interviewees being in on the gag from the start."" Surely, people would see through Borat fairly quickly. How many people hitch-hike with a film crew, after all? So, overall, I'd give this a paper-thin, very marginal thumbs up, but no more.

I like the heroine, Pen Fairfax, who is unique and unusual without being annoying, and the hero was dreamy. As is the norm with Ms. Robinson's works, the writing was excellent. I am not the biggest fan of a romance in which one party has amnesia, which is why I docked the rating one star. Lord of Enchantment is still an enjoyable addition to the series."

Alvarez's unique stle of writing makes the book very interesting and gives you many different perspectives to see the situation in which they lived. Although this is a fiction book, Alvarez gives insight as to what the times were like in Dominican Republic when it was under the rule of Trujillo. In following the lives of these four sisters, you will see the hardships and joys of growing up. This book also does a great job of showing the how these girls were able to adapt to a new culture, and shows the different cycles they go through as they adapt to the United States. I recommend this book very highly. It's different, but enjoyable."

Mr. Mills leaves you hanging in a lot of instances for chapters while you are trying to figure out what is happening and why. It's extremely well written and I highly recommend it.

I started losing track after I counted 1,426...not counting the times I got lost and had to navigate my way out.They have managed to avoid all the heartbreak of editing on this disc. There are numerous unnecessary and repetitive sub-menus. How about a shot of a cardboard stand-up figure of a main character? Then how about a shot of it's blank backside?

It has nothing to do with his drumming or voice, just plain bad writing, its too poppy and overdone, no good melodies or lyrics. Not even good music... when peter said he wanted to do an album not like a KISS album... he did it... but making a bad album... its no wonder why his solo album went on to do the worse of the 4.

Now that he's 3.5 years old the uke was too small and he asked for a larger ""guitar"" -- with a strap. After considerable investigation, this Schoenhut guitar seemed the best match for his age, size, coordination, interest. I have tuned it to an E major chord and he is proud to be on stage with his ""real guitar."" He's only had it for a month, but thus far it seems to be a good match.

They were traveling west in the late 1700's when they stopped at a spring and drank from it. The spring had magical powers and granted them an immortal life. The movie focuses on the love story between young Winifred (Alexis) and the youngest Tuck son, Jesse. Someone discovers the Tuck's secret and eventually the Tucks have to leave, but not before Jesse has to decide between Winifred and his family.

It contains graphics and photographs in a clean design that help convey the ideas. I found the book was written for high level business negotiators, but most of the tips would be helpful in dealing with car dealers, gas stations, banks, stores, utility companies, or even a significant other.

Trying to make a cat chase after flowers around a gazebo (with cursor & enter keys), only to lose the flowers as soon as you get one - is frustrating as hell.I'm a programmer, and tried it myself. Now I see why the kids are crying. How frustrating to play a game for hours/days, only to find out that it cannot be completed. Mattel/Activision should be ashamed.What is the recourse for customers that have paid for this game? Oh, yeah, I forgot. Once you open it, you cannot return it. No more Mattel or Activision games for us."

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","You'll never need another how-to book This book may have a hefty price, but it is well worth it. I purchased it originally just for photo class, but it is the best book that I could have bought. There is everything photographers could ever want to know, and it grows with you. If you are a beginner, then just start slowly with the first few chapters that guide you through cameras, film, and developing and then progress to more complicated things. I recommend this book to every photographer because it is a wonderful reference book for any questions you have."

The RP3200 inflates the tire, the automatic feature operates as advertised and the device is easy to operate.At the same time, these observations should be noted:The vibration that occurs when it is operating is such that the device must be held down or it will jump around.The inflation valve goes on easily, but some force is required to remove it. In the process, some air escapes from the tire.The inflation hose and the power cable must be folded carefully in order to store them in the compartment provided on the back of the RP3200.I would recommend this product."

The sound is as it should be, but what I miss is slapping bass on some numbers.Blue Moon and Sh-Boom is interesting rock 'n'roll with reggae rhythm, Giving My Love to You is a rock 'n' roll ballad and the only real ballad that they ever recorded.Recorded with pretty much the same line-up as the first one with exception of Mike Sanchez (piano). Now piano is under guidance of James Sumner (Soul Hooligan).If the first record was mostly covers, on this one you'll find mostly originals.This record is 100% fun."

I got mine second hand so it was free and when my son was just eating formula it worked great. You have to buy refills but they lasted awhile because we only genied the stinky ones. Now that he is eating normal food we have to wrap the diapers in cheap baggies from the dollar store and then put them in the genie. We have ultimately discovered that these cheap 1.00 bags actually work all by themselves in the garbage. We empy the garbage enough that there isn't any smell. This was convenient to have next the changing table for the first year. Then we got rid of the changing table and just haven't needed it.

He wasn't able to transform it over night, but then again, he couldn't do the Transformer ones either. Once he got the transformation of this Starfighter, he's been unstoppable and happy!

I wanted to correct my grammar which weren't very good but Derrida did not help me he was talking difficult stuff.While my grammar was attacked however, Miss Rogers did concede my principal point, which was that Derrida, having constructed his own metanarrative, is as susceptible to wilful misinterpretation through the prism of other metanarratives as he inflicts on others. Moreover, in some of Derrida's earlier essays, he specifically attacks Heidegger for misunderstanding what he means when accounting for his own form of deconstruction. Yet it seems to me - and surely to most? - that the central tenet of deconstruction is this: that authorial intent cannot be guaranteed as ultimate meaning; and that ultimate meaning does not exist. Vive la differance? Or does he need a kick up the arche?Miss Rogers gave me a B- for anyone interested."

No, I'm only going to mention that my hopes for Atlas Shrugged Part 1 -- the first installment of a planned trilogy -- tumbled like the housing project in The Fountainhead. In the year 2016, a group of individualistic industrialists are being targeted by the forces of mediocrity and socialism. It's up to Dagny Taggart and Henry Rearden to save the nation from economic ruin -- and maybe find out who some guy named John Galt is. I found Atlas Shrugged, Part 1 to be a low-budget bore that does little to elucidate Rand's ideas; if you're a fan of the book, however, you may want to give the Blu-ray a shot, as it contains several making-of docs and a commentary track with the filmmakers."

The lack of heat retention is a problem even with doing all the right things (taking the caraf off of the machine and making sure the top is closed tight).

After a few months of daily use, the switch quit working. Even before it quit, the switch started acting finicky and wouldn't take the shot right away.

I wish I bought that the first time. It works so much better and without any wires to get in the way. The only downside is you can't take a photo from behind the camera with the wireless.

The fact that the Chunnel is in operation today has to be one of man's greatest achievements. The story of the construction of the tunnel itself is amazing, but the entire history and the efforts of the companies, governments, and individuals is even more incredible. However, the book itself is did not do this story justice. I found it very difficult to follow both chronologically and factually. The book jumped around in time which made it hard to distinguish how things took place. There were so many characters not germaine to the project that it was hard to keep the names of the people involved straight. I found that without diagrams or illustrations, the explanations of the construction and engineering was difficult to comprehend, and I am an engineer. I understand there may be a video, I suggest renting it instead!"

This grated throughout what would have otherwise been a good book - a solid mystery with a bunch of different pieces that converge and fall into place quite nicely at the end. In the end, a small slip-up will probably cause me not to read any more of his books. It's like the author of Deadly Doses: A Writer's Guide to Poisons put it - if you're going to poison someone, make sure you do you homework. This should hold true for any method of murder... Also, he mentioned the Elephant Child and the Limpopo River, and in reading that text, I'm not at all sure it actually had the implications he meant!"

I am a homeschooling mom. I do not deeply distrust my government. The basic premise of this book may have slight credibility, (yes, Stalin did kill more people than Hitler). Yet, ""Uncle Eric"" makes some pretty over-the-top claims. Claims such as, ""The Jewish Holocaust gets the publicity because it is regarded as the justification for Jews to have a Jewish state (Israel) in the Mideast."",(pg 36), and in regards to Pearl Harbor, ""Few are willing to face the possiblity that the President and his cronies planned it all.""

I watched this last night and overall it was pretty well done, but what bothered me to give it only three stars where the horrible acting that the sons of Laban had in the movie. Also what was really disappointing is that Jacob went straight over to Rachel when it was different in the bible as some of you may know. The running time was sort of sad too, I wish it could have gone on longer and extended but sometimes you just can't. All and all it was much better than watching some of the stuff on television today."
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","An unique perspective of a dark soul This is a unique work which is presented entirely in character monologue, diary entries and media clippings, all of which relate to one Herman Mudgett, a man of many names and one dark purpose. To read of Herman's nonchalant attitude toward killing is equally chilling than being given blow-by-blow accounts of his misdeeds, and that for me was the true horror.The structure of this novel may remind some of Stephen King's Carrie, which was written in a similar way. All in all, the book is a quick yet engrossing read."

I was expecting much more color and detail, but found too much generic patterns that didn't turn me on. I have a 500 MHz PIII with 128 megs of RAM. The planes are fun, but the scenery was really boring with a lot of flickering and visual instability. I ran the program on my friend's 1 Gig Athlon with 258 megs of RAM and a Nvidia G2 graphics accelerator, but there was no real difference. I was also disappointed at the lack of shadow from the planes as they approach the ground, which means that there's no way of telling how close you are until you crash.I played this game for about 6 hours total, then got bored and uninstalled it. It's quite a lot of fun, the planes are nice, but the scenery is a drag."

Death of a Beekeeper showed some promise initially but never managed to deliver losing direction about a third (?) of the way in. Banalities take precidence: 'You can never truly appreciate things until you are in danger of losing them' blah, blah, blah...soap operas suffice for such insight. Otherwise, the remainder of the novel, written as fragments in the notebooks of the protagonist, resembles fragments in the notebooks for the idea of a novel by a writer who never quite puts the effort in to fully flesh them out. There are some beautiful passages but overall, the novel is aimless and not particularly coherent."
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Compellingly Written, Directed, and Delivered Growing up in New York City is never simple, even for the most privileged of adolescents. And the age of twelve is arguably the most impressionable period for a youngster. So when a young girl witnesses something exceptionally brutal, adolescence may evaporate just as the early morning dew. This is a slice of the dilemma that `Mathilda' (Natalie Portman) inherits in this film. ""Leon,"" the title character played by Jean Reno, inherits Mathilda and the dilemma. Portman delivers a performance of circumstance well beyond her years with style, savvy, and intelligence. The powers that be could have easily entitled this one ""Mathilda,"" because she creates the dynamics of the story, and adds a pleasant wrinkle to the neo-noir genre. However, it must be duly noted that Jean Reno renders a creative and daring portrayal of a heartless assassin who slips to care."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A decline in talent........ This cd starts off with the worst song The Get Up Kids have ever written. Oddly enough, this cd shows how The Get Up Kids have gotten significantly worse over time. Since when do unpassionate singing and pianos have a place in rock. (Nobody can call this emo either because it is not) The only reason I would recommend this cd is for the last six songs. Everything else on this cd is a pathetic attempt at giving high school kids some kind of motivation. They will think to themselves, wow, girls don't like me, and one day I will could be able to write terrible sappy songs about it and make loads of money. This cd has absolutely no passion, not to mention intelligence, until the last five songs. People, go buy Four Minute Mile, and understand why the get up kids were good at one point in time."

I WANT to be entertained by these films. I truly do. But this film does NOT! It's horrible. It's just too infantile. This film droned on for near to three hours. Even William Friedkin and Blatty edited ""Exorcist"" for the screen. A novel this long? Lord, I can't seem to find an escape from this boredom. The young adult love is nauseating at best. The ONLY good point to this film is it's set design. To compare this film to ""Wizard Of Oz"" is absurd. ""Oz"" cannot be compared to ""Hogbore""."

It's a long, sometimes tedious, read but one has to give author Goddard a silver star for being able to weave all the myriad of plotting into a cohesive resolution. The plot is way too labyrinthine to go into detail here, but suffice to say it involves the murder of an elderly spinster, a dead heroic poet, a young niece trying to find out who killed her aunt; a somewhat sleazy antiques dealer and the brother accused of the murder; the young girl's brother and his promiscuous wife; an American cad; and the Spanish Civil War.There's lots of twists and turns, and although I didn't find it one of my favorite reads, it's a well developed if somewhat lengthy read."

The book contains hardly background information which cannot be found in other sources. In addition there are more but a few errors about the facts. After all: My English isn't perfect but the author's isn't either.As a whole considering the price a little bit disappointing and no more than 3 stars.

A two part film,the first dealing with a marine bootcamp,and the second centering on Vietnam during the 1968 Tet Offensive. Bleak,Ironic,and perversely funny. This film offers little hope & even less humanity. The first part, is the most riveting pieces of film I've ever seen. You tend to feel numb as it fades into the second half. Making the viewer feeling a bit let down. I'ts not as strong as the first, it's a bit detached and unstructured. But I think that was the intent. The film shows a surreal view of combat. The film's climax is both suspenseful and very haunting. The last image of the marines walking through a burned out city is both bizzare and unforgettable. Superb direction,cinematography,acting, and great sound, ( the sounds of distant explosions & gunfire) are just one example. The music is both conventional and eerie. This is Stanley Kubrick's best film."

However, George Harrison's ""Horse to the Water,"" second song, is his last recording and makes the CD worth the price. Eric Clapton and Sam Brown do great jobs on their selections. 3 *** stars"

The parts we fast-forwarded were parts where there were girls that were hardly dressed in bikinis, Josh & his girlfriend were heavily making out, these are things I don't care to see in a ""Christian"" movie and I certainly don't want my boys to see. Although the story line is good the moral rating is NOT. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."

Westlake is complicating his plots further and further as he progresses in the series and it really adds to what other wise would be a whole lot of hot air. I totally dis-agree with the other reviewers here giving this book five stars. ""Watch Your Back"" is a fun book but it does not stand up to classics like Chandler or Jim Thompson. I think that even Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiasson have a few books between themselves that easily out shine this story. But all of my belly-aching aside, if you have read most of the rest of this series and are looking forwards to catching up with old friends like I was, this will be a satisfying novel.

There is no protective finish on this slicer to repel moisture or keep it in good order when cleaning with soap and water. Also, when I tried out the sliding box that holds the cabbage, there was an area that the box would not readily slide through. Upon further investigation I found the base of the slicer was warped, where two diagonally opposite sides were not on the same plane as the other two sides. In essence, it was a rocking horse.It seems to me that before this thing leaves the manufacturer, someone should be checking the product.Very poor workmanship and quality even though a close grained wood was used in its production.I am presently warping this thing in the opposite direction before I apply a clear epoxy paint finish."

I kept waiting for her to flesh out her old cow/new cow theory, but instead she kept repeating the same joke page after page, chapter after chapter. I wanted to laugh, but the book just wasn't funny.

Colfer uses ""mud people"" and variations on it as the standard reference to surface dwellers throughout the book. I know the author is Irish, not American, and may not be aware of the use (or mis-use) of the term, but his American publisher certainly should be.If Scholastic Books can change the title of ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" to ""Sorcerer's Stone"" for distribution in the USA, then Hyperion should be able to edit the Artemis Fowl series to get rid of this objectionable, and unfortunately American-based, slur."

One might be able to abstract out a particular behavior from a great leader, however mimicing that behavior is not making another great leader, not necessary.For example, no doubt, Steve Job may be a great leader in Apple, but 'possibly' he might violate several of other laws... is he still a good leader judging by the rest of laws?

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Requires PreFrozen Bowl This unit requires that your refrigerator prefreezes the bowl. With that in mind, the unit only mixes the ingredients as heat is transferred from your ice cream/sorbet mixture to the bowl which you just took out of the refrigerator. Moreover, most of the recipes in the book require lots of sugar. For instance to make a lemon sorbet, you need to dissolve 3 cups of sugar to 3 cups of water before adding the lemon juice and lemon/lime zest. So I think that unless you are young enough to not need to worry about dieting and getting fat, you will have to modify the recipes. In sum, I think it is better to get the 50BC cuisinart with the compressor so that you don't need to use your refrigerator to freeze the bowl, which is what I intend to do when I can afford it. I also intend to modify the recipes to reduce the caloric intake of whatever I am making."

The story flowed and I didn't feel the need to skim over the smuggling plot as it wasn't too boring. The h wasn't too annoying despite the fact that she was a spinster, independent and against marrying. The H was funny because he was macho and not keen on marriage either as he'd been hurt in the past. Once again his past hurt wasn't a big deal and didn't spoil the romance.The first part of the book was very entertaining with quite a few laugh out loud moments. The second part focussed on solving the traitor problem and the developing romance. I enjoyed the secondary characters too.All in all in was a good read for a lazy Autumn weekend."

I needed it to write a paper for college, but after it took a week and a half to get to my house, ironically it came the same day as the paper was due and I failed the class. It was my fault for waiting so long to order it, but I had looked everywhere else, plus where on earth did it ship from that it took that long. I will NEVER go through Amazon.com again.p.s. the book is still in its packaging since their was no use in opening it"

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Very Unreliable and Extremely Short Flight Time I agree with the two reviewers who came before me. I bought this plane about 2 months ago (from an eBay merchant). The first plane sent to me would not charge. After paying for the additional cost of shipping the product back to the merchant, I got a replacement plane that would charge and would fly for about 30 seconds per charge. However, on a turn, one of the two props needs to slow down and the plane would nose dive into the ground. The plane was just too heavy for the output power of the props. Don't buy this plane. Buy the one made by Silverlit. Silverlit makes a plane that looks almost identical to this plane but works a whole lot better."

The other reviews that praise this movie are very misleading. To put it simply, this film stinks. The cinematography is horrid, the music is worse (Western pop from the sixties), the story line is pitiful and there is no acting in this film. It is not a drama nor a comedy. It is a tragedy. This movie was given one star because reviewers are not allowed to give no stars. Amazon.com should be more honest in the reviews they promote if they want return customers.DON'T BUY THIS FILM.

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A winning formula, wrong book The Beach was a good book. Why? Because it combined travelling with adventure in a way that many guide books do not. I snapped up a copy of The Tesseract hoping to travel through the Philippines without actually going there and be persuaded that I should. I read this book three months ago and cannot remember anything about it, other than it was set in the Philippines. If you want a suspense thriller with travel, buy Le Carre. If you want travel pure and simple, buy that guide book. If you want to waste your money, try Las Vegas. Don't buy this. Mr Garland should takle several leaves from Mr Grisham: develop the winning formula first, then repeat it. And then repeat it.

The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (original) was a classic that was gruesome, but it provided serious tension and fear. That adrenaline fight or flight response that draws us to horror films. This movie is nothing of the sort, and anyone who attempts to justify this trash by saying that it was humorous is by definition as sick and deprived person themselves. There was nothing funny about this film like the goofy humor in Piranha 3D or some of the smart humor in Scream.This movie is foul. The morality of anyone who laughs at the screams and pain of others as they are forced to digest the bowel movements of someone else sown to their very face is definitely in question."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Not necessary for good vocal mics I got this preamp because I heard I needed a preamp as well as phantom power for an AKG studio condenser mic that I was also purchasing; and that it would also ""warm up"" the sound a bit. That might help for cheap mics but there was absolutely no voice quality difference with 2 mid-range mics under diff recording tests than straight to an Mbox 2 mini. As a matter of fact, I got a little extra noise. (but that is prob due to the extra cable connection) I can't say what it will do for instruments, but for voice, it is totally not necessary if you have a good mic and interface. If not, then you probably need something like this.Things I liked: Solid metal build, 2 kinds of jacks, price.Things I hated: Gets very hot doing nothing, No on/off switch (you have to unplug it from the back each time)Although this preamp may work just swell, those last 2 hated points were enough for me to give it 2 stars."

Overall the main concept of this box is a good one and after watching the instructional video someone did on line here it was pretty easy and it does clean litter the way it claims to BUT the two pieces never really snapped together from the start and with time even a generous amount of tape to seal it still meant litter everywhere. Once sealed with tape it is hard to put in new litter. Box is very large and works well. I tried this instead of getting an automated scooper. Wishing I spent the big bucks and gone the other route. Also if you manage to get a box with a better seal and snap and have any kind of bad back, knee pain physically maneuvering the box by rocking it is not the best idea. Full of litter to capacity and the angle you are at is not back breaking but if you are half way there this small motion over and over again might be enough to finish the job."

I'm an average size female and pushing this around was easy for me.I love that I can tip it over to clean and not have to worry about gas & oil spills.

I got this goal after becoming a huge Dave Ramsey fan. I read his book, Total Money Makeover and loved it. Now I listed to his free podcasts everyday.One of the books he highly recommends is The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas Stanley. This book will change the way you look at your next door neighbor, and the way you may think while driving through an upper class neighborhood. This book shows you how the tortoise continually beats the hair in the race to building wealth.The book does have it's boring parts and can often read like an owners manual with lots of statistical data. But between all the stats and data the book can be highly motivating to help you save instead of spend. You'll learn all about PAWS & UAWS and what it means to have a big hat and no cattle.Without going too much into it, I would say that although dull it is a good read with lots of hard core statistical surprises."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Avoidable Of all the legal textbooks I've had to read in the past 2 years, this one by Fowler is my least favorite. Most annoying are the voluminous footnotes, which appear on every page and sometimes taking up 1/4 to 1/2 of the page. If an author needs to quote something, then they should just quote and parenthetically cite. Citations and notes are far better relegated to the end of a chapter. Otherwise, the extraneous text on every page is merely distracting and is not conducive to study.The book is also written in a ""chatty"" fashion, sounding more like a lecture than a textbook. There are many anecdotes and other bits of information that may be interesting, but wander from the point of the chapter.I would consider this a book to read at leisure by anyone interested in law, but in my opinion it is not suitable for use as a primary textbook."

The overall sound is brighter without the twang and the bass strings have more projection. If you have a $100-$600 guitar this would be worthwhile, in my opinion."

Girlswill learn what colonial children did for fun, whattheir chores were, what their education was like, and what the social customs were at the time.The main character, Felicity, is headstrong, butalso kind and loving.

Now, I'm not saying this sort of thing doesn't happen in the world, but I sure do not support it and do not want to spend my hard earned money to read about women who need psychological help or a better moral compass. Does media follow society or does society fuel the media? I think it's definitely both... but I know a good way to rectify it.

And the straight FBI agent is a homophobic jerk. There is no love story here - in spite of what the editorial review from IN Los Angeles says.

If you've seen the second arc then you know Kenshin has already conquered the manslayer within him, Saito is supposedly dead, and Sanosuke Seighara has mastered a punch called the Tio-fukenoki-wammi (however you spell that crap). In this movie, however, Kenshin allows the manslayer within to emerge, Saito reappears and Sanosuke has no knowledge of the tio-fukenoki-wammi (however you spell that crap).This storty, plainly putting it, makes no sense whatsoever.

They have some rubber studs on the palm, but the rest is woven cotton! They got very wet instantly when I wore them and didn't dry out for days.I can only think that the reviews that say they got a waterproof glove got a very different glove, so: be warned!"

I installed the software as directed pluged in the mp3 player as the manual instucted to do, and i cannot download any songs onto the player! The manual says nothing about connecting the player except conect player to computer! A friend mentioned something about a printer port having to be changed or something?? If this is the case, then i am very upset that the manual does not discuss this inportant step to have the ability to put music on the player! More than likley, it is my lack of computer skills that do not allow me to properly connect the player! I think this player would probably be great if i can evre figure out how to connect it with my computer. If anyone knows how to do this properly or what the deal is with the printer ports, please email me with your help or suggestions (neuf_07@yahoo.com)"

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",2 stars only cause a small amount a effort was put into it Let me start by saying do not listen to the reviews that the game is too easy. It just seems easy at the start that way. I do like the weapon upgrade but not when that is the only thing can you upgrade. Your defense is upgraded in the lamest way possible by finding littlt chests with pie in it. The game is 50 hours long but not worth it. The dungens as I am sure you heard are repetive bu the only thing worse than that is the battle music. It may be good with at the most 20 hours but not a second more. The only reason why I continued playing was to see happened next and it was something easily predictable. So do not I repeated do not make the biggest misake of your life.

Also did some bird watching and found the brightness and color accurracy also much better than the cheaper pair. Another pleasant surprise was the Nikon allowed viewing at a much closer distance really making their range for viewing much more practical. The weight is about the same as the cheaper pair and I can only wish they were half the weight but this weight seems to be about the norm for this size pair. Plan to take them with me on all hikes and trips. They seem to be very well constructed and the rubberized coating makes them easy to use and comfortable. Recommend them to anyone looking for a pair in this size range."

Previously owned an HP printer, which was bulker, so I bought this printer because it was more stream-lined. They also had a special deal on it when we bought our computer. However, it eats ink much more than the HP. Also the ink for the Cannon is harder to find in stores, and is more costly than other brands. I bought ink for this printer about a month ago, after using the printer for two weeks, the low ink display came on. It kept showing this everytime I would print. Two weeks later since the first display came on, the ink is now completly empty. Typically we print about ten pages a week. The HP printer was more expensive, but the ink was less, and the Cannon was cheaper and the ink is more. Maybe that is the trade off."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Dated and not useful As other reviewers have stated, this book (published in 1907) is so dated one wonders how it is even still in print. Perhaps the only value is the author teaches you about tuning the piano using the slower beating 4ths and 5ths method (once the main method, aural tuners now predominantly use the faster beating 3rds and 6ths method). However, even this method is explained cumbersomely by the author. The section of repairing piano parts and regulation is anemic and terribly short considering the complexities of a piano. Poor illustrations with an antiquated writing style, this book is best left in the dustbin of piano literature."

They were a fantastically well matched pair. The only way to describe these two is, PASSIONATE, STRONG, AND DETERMINED!The mission to destroy drug labs in the amazon basin was definitely only a mild diversion. Even the bad blood between the Colonel leading the mission and Inca (their guide), barely caused a ripple. The focus is firmly on Inca and Roan just as it should be. This story is more 'mystical' than the previous Morgans Mercenaries. Some people may not enjoy that as much but it was perfect for a story about Inca. TERRIFIC!"

I would have liked to see a little more thought go into it.Mindless as it is, don't expect ""Desperate Housewives"" or ""Scrubs"" kind of entertainment, but maybe ""The Dukes of Hazard"" or ""News Radio (after Phil Hartman died)"". Dick Chaney is in it (hell, that is) and the whole ""Edgy Kreep"" thing is funny.If Hell were a book, it would be this book. I must say, however, I enjoyed it almost as much as I liked ""...Heaven"" which isn't saying much.

Of course the pals are disappointed when they open their gifts, but they later figure out on their own the good wishes behind each gift--and the best way to put the gifts to real, everyday use.Any small child can begin to learn from this book the secret of choosing to be happy with what you have, instead of worrying about what you don't have, and parents and kids alike will get a kick out of Chris Riddell's vivid illustrations."

They were very cheap, so I wasn't expecting first-rate construction, but they work fine. Most importantly, they are as pictured, with a short length of wire connecting the male and female ends. I was worried, by some previous reviews, that they would actually arrive as a single molded piece, without the flexible wire; this would not have worked for my needs."
5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A ""must have"" of the French garage music scene This vital album shows the deluge of external cultural influences that are shaping both French music and society. Musically rich, at times both playful and tongue-in-cheek, this album showcases ""garage music"" a la francaise with its Spanish and North African themes.The lyrics are both humourous and at times bitingly satirical. The images are likewise grotesque, compelling, and laughable: showing the tragically mundane in everyday life.Perhaps the lead singer's best work before his unfortunate overdose."

The motion detector was terribly inefficient as it could not detect my 100lb son entering or exiting the room when activated.

The siren is so low I could not hear it over the noise of the fan that I had running in my room and I sleep very lightly....Don't settle on this product, KEEP SEARCHING!

There are not many musicians in the world that can write the lyrics, sing the songs and compose the music and come up with a great CD. Stevie isn't a one-person band and this CD relies too much on her voice to keep your attention. The band just stays in the background and adds nothing to Stevie's effort. The result is a repetitive and a lackluster CD."

Not the usual Anne Perry's book Even though I knew it would be a totally different book from the ones she usually writes I was very disspointed.

At first, it seemed like it was going to be interesting, but then after about 80 pages or so, it became so boring that I finally stopped reading it. Even from a Mormon's point of view, this book is weird, and boring.BUT, I would like to tell people who said that it was their first ""Anne Perry"" book and were dissapointed to the point of not wanting to read any other book of hers, PLEASE, READ HER ""PITT"" AND ""MONK"" SERIES.

I have used TU for two years in my Enterprise class for freshmen at our business school. The book is very popular (especially Victoria's Secret and Callaway Golf)with my students. I wish the authors would update the book again with more explanation of TU during hard economic times as well as adding a chapter on the impact of the Internet on trading up. I think the key point of TU is that the middle market (undifferentiated products and service) is being replaced by premium companies ""trading down"" and discounters ""trading up"". This theme should be more explicit in the next edition. In addition, more emphasis should be placed on services in the trading up phenomenon, since were heading toward a service economy in the US. I would also add more on the phenomenon through the eyes of global consumers and companies. Overall, I plan to use the book again next semester, along with complementary case studies from HBR."
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Terrible I bought this because other reviewers ... compared her to Ledisi, Jill Scott, and Erykah Badu. She may have a voice that compares to those artists, but she has absolutely none of the creativity and originality of those three giants. This cd is boring and monotonous. Every song sounds the same. A good voice just isn't enough. A lot of women can blow, but more is needed to separate a good singer from the rest of the pack. What makes those other artists that I named so great is that they take risks and incorporate other types of music like reggae, hip-hop, jazz, go-go, and even latin music into their work. They are not just singers, but artists!"

He has really transformed the lives of every child he has ever meet. I felt that I learned so much more about the middle east, specifically Pakistan and Afghanistan than the media reports and the government every taught me.

In between lie classics like Pohl's satiric Day Million, Silverberg's Nightwings and a story related to Gene Wolfe's Book of the Sun series.

He decides to go to the barn to meet Casey, who introduces him to the Star Runner, a crazy untamed horse. Later Travis finds that he and the Star Runner have a lot in common.I didn't care for this book because it didn't have a lot to do with the Star Runner. I think S.E. Hinton should have added more detail on how the Star Runner got tamed. I would recommend this book to a young adult like Travis: a procrastinator from the city. I think this because I feel if you're like the character you can understand more about the story you're being told. It was an okay book."

It is very loud, clogs often and the tools fall off the hose too easy. I mounted it on the wall in the garage and thought it would be great for quick cleanups of the car and floor. It does neither well. The small hose diameter and poor suction stop it from picking up any large items. (It will not pick up leaves off the garage floor). To make maters worse the hose size is identical to the disposable clear plastic caps on top of water bottles. If you happen to vacuum one up, it gets stuck in the hose and takes quite a bit of time and effort to get out. I rarely use it anymore. A cordless dust buster has more power and is much quieter."

My favorite scenes are of Tanis and Laurana. I know I am a guy, but I do like romance in books! Good story throughout, even though you know who the killer is early on, unless you were a Basketball player from the University of Arkansas. The big problems I did have were that the relationship of Tanis and Laurana is left hanging. I wanted one more scene at the end.

(And the words aren'tcarefully selected, either.) You'll find it difficult to chew anddigest so many words at one time, esp. since there aren't a lot of exercises to go along with them.The book has some minor blemishes as well, but these two reasonsare so weighty that I can only recommend that you look elsewhere.I like Wheelock a lot better with all the quotes from ancient writers and the words marked for pronunciation."

Although songs such as ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"", ""Alfie"", and ""The Look Of Love"" have been heard a million times, Isley and Bacharach treat them as if they were recorded for the first time. So kick off your shoes, pour the wine and be prepared to be startled by the collaboration of these two giants. Essential!!!"

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","I think this book really relates to a lot of people's lives. As I said above, this book is very realistic not in the sense that everybody is rich and famous just that most kids that I know have parents who put a lot of pressure on them to succeed. In baby-sitters club it's not as realistic. It's like they have a problem and within the same book it's solved. It's not like that in real life."
5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","One of the best books ever Yeah, I dont mean to come across the wrong way but i do have a degree in philosophy and i honestly think this is one of the best books i have ever read. Even in light of Kant, Hume, Locke, (Descartes sucks), Aristotle etc... This book does NOT seem to create an original system of philosophical thinking, rather this book is a synthesis of all intellectual pursuits put together, Anthropology, psychology, neurology, philosophy, history, etc... His main thesis is determinism, which in my opinion will be the next revolution in the culture of mankind... Similar to the so called Darwinian Revolution... In a nutshell our brains, more than our environments or so called free will, control our actions...I highly recommend this book..."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Help comes too easily to the main character I borrowed this book via Prime. What really bothered me is that all the help Diana got just seemed too easy.** Slight spoilers **In every situation, men were falling all over each other to help her. Jim decides to take her under his wing after seeing her ride once & barely speaking to her. Steve decides to give her Navarro & helps her train him. Bill falls in love with her after seeing her once. The crazy french guy fakes a heart attack so she'll come back to his boat with her.It goes on & on.Even up to the end when she get set up financially (how convienent).Aside from being gorgeous (which was described over & over) I didn't see what was so special about her. It made it hard for me to connect with her as a character.I would've rather seen Diana do more things on her own to create her success - like trying modeling for a while to make money, so she could pursue her real dream - instead of crying that she wanted her equestrian success immediately."

I saw only one reference to the Peace Corps in the index. 1968 was a year in which the number of American Peace Corps Volunteers were at their zenith. Peace Corps Volunteers were serving in large numbers in Iran and Afghanistan in 1968. Both of these countries were displaying civility in this crucial year. There was little civil unrest in either nation at that time. This is juxtaposed to the riots in much of Western Europe and the USA. Such is this dichotomy.

I am not shy to sex on television but I hate this show. Snotty bitches complaining about things they should be grateful for.

As for Gaiman's theories about hell and its purpose, that's just his opinion and it wasn't very insightful to me.

Her mother and friends believe that this changing is caused by her hormones, but her sister believes that she was bitten by a werewolf. Sooner Brigitte sees that she is right and tries to save her sister from the terrible fate.This is an unusual horror film. There are no jokes, very little humour and the attack scenes are strong (this is NOT for weak stomaches) and there's an overall very depressing atmosphere.Not bad for a Canadian film."

It's obvious that Eric has something else on his mind. I think it's time he got down to whatever it is, rather than take the easy way out in order to pump out another album. In short, this album has very little of Robert Johnson, and a whole lot of 'formula' music, designed to keep the public appeased. I see absolutely no reason to have released this album when Robert Johnson's collected works can be heard as they were intended."

So, the stand doesn't hold the mailbox, which is not light by the way,you need a drill gun to put it together(tried the screw driver and it took forever to screw in 1 screw) and the bee has a vibrating sound that after 5 min of hearing it you want to throw the whole thing out the window.

There is no stimulation for the imagination here -- it is the same thing over and over. And it is made in China. Once you put it together, it cannot come apart, so it will never fit into the box again.

The suits have been completely changed as well as the symbolism of the pictures on the cards. It does come with a mini book that is very useful for learning the cards. These cards also don't need to be done with reversed or upside down cards. In fact I wouldn't know how to read a reversed card with this deck. lol.

But I was kind of disappointed after I've read some of the reviews here. I was going to purchase the book, but I'm having second thoughts. Kevin shouldn't have misled people by the title of his book.

The young girl (Olivia Olson) is such an exciting surprise talent in the film but her song on the CD sounds like it was recorded in a tin can. And the comeback Xmas song doesn't even sound like the same song or that it's even sung by the same artist (Billy Mack). What a bummer!!! On the plus side, ""Songbird"" by Eva Cassidy is worth the price of the CD, and it's nice to hear an older and wiser Joni Mitchell singing her seminal ""Both Sides Now"" so many years later."

Backed by Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, and the still-incarcerated Tony Yayo, 50 cent's 'Beg for mercy' is not you're typical support group album. Each member of G-unit can hold his own lyrically. Tracks like 'Stunt 101' and 'Guns for sale' are the same thugged out, arrogant and heavy spitting music that made 50 Cent hot. Althought it's going to have a tough time with comparisons to 'Get rich of die trying,' G-Unit comes just as hard on this album, if not harder. Banks, Yayo and Young Buck add their own hunger and determination to the mix."

But in Mr. Williams' book, one also learns that, although more publicized, the United States of America isn't the only country with psychos!"

And so we are delivered yet another Kennedyana kernel, this one by ""New York Times"" reporter Adam Clymer. The book fails to capture the spirit and humanity of the man; the insights are surprisingly shallow for such a respected journalist. On the Chappaquiddick incident, during which a young female Kennedy supporter was drowned when the car in which Ted was driving went off the road, leaves Clymer writing the shocking news that Kennedy was a bad driver who ""probably"" was drinking prior to the accident! A faded rose indeed."

You wouldn't know it from the book's self-description, but it is primarily aimed at marketing large law firms (100+ lawyers) with huge marketing budgets. If you are a small firm or solo practitioner, look elsewhere. Even in terms of its big-firm focus, the book is far too broad and generic to provide much useful advice and guidance."

So i went back to the book so it can show me how to sync it back up. I did that and had a reading again. I go back to sit down in my kitchen and it happens again. I then sat next to this thing for about 15 mins and it did it again. Obviously this is not working as designed. Which makes me not happy with this product. Also, if you are using this with a PROQ or Weber Smokey Mountain (WSM) smoker, the probe will not fit through the eyelid that came pre-fab on your smoker, which is a bummer as well."

It reviews the ""19 building blocks"" of divorce, going over each of the significant emotions/stages a recently divorced person experiences. As far as my experience goes, the emotions identified were all correct. According to the book, if you work through all the stages you arrive at ""freedom."" It does include information for parents, but it was separated in the chapters, so a divorcee without children could easily skip those sections.My problem with the book was the writing style. I felt like the author spoke in a slightly condescending tone and kept reminding the reader how well he knows us and how wonderful and correct his program is.

Upon further research on the internet, I found out that it is not recommended that anyone take a product containing senna for any longer than 7 days -- I took this for about 14 days. I'm not sure if the cramps had anything to do with the senna but I believe it's a word of caution worth mentioning."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Sweet, but Overly Sentimental This little book (generously type-set to make 167 pages) is set for the most part on the Hebridean island of ""Erinsay"" (not to be confused with the real island of Eriskay). Its hero is Jamie Stuart, a greedy, selfish yuppie at the outset of the book, who travels to Erinsay, miraculously goes back in time, and has a complete change of heart when he falls in love with a woman in the past. The protagonist's transformation is not believable, and the reader has too hard a time forgiving him for his earlier despicable behavior. Ultimately, when he commits his final selfless act, the reader is left feeling grateful but, unfortunately, not really saddened. Also, as a lover of the Hebrides myself (the reason I read the book in the first place) I was disappointed by how the author belittles the people who live there by characterizing them as quaint, superstitious souls--a stereotype that is sadly lacking in truth."

Apparently this is a hit for them and until they develop new episodes they will repackage the old in this fashion. Shame on them.

No one knows what is in this manuscript but Kate's passion for Elizabethan espionage has her brain dancing.Silbert weaves the story from 2 different time periods, showing how the actions of Christopher ""Kit"" Marlowe, playwright and spy, have shaped the reactions of the villians in the 21st century. The chapters switch between Marlowes world and Kate's world, and you are never truly sure who the bad guy is until the end.What kept this from being a 5* book is that one story line seemed to just fall short.

Approaching her subject with the hands of an experienced nurse, the voice of an experienced mother, the heart of a pastor, and the eye of a writer she offers what I would like to prescribe to my patients parenting teen girls - practical advice on how to enjoy the relationship of focused, yet not overbearing, intentional parenting.

Not that it's not something everyone should have in their collection, but if important scenes are taken out, like when David Ruffin is telling the other Tempatations about his home life and feeling being apart of the group is the first thing he's ever been apart of in his life while sitting at the kitchen table, or going back to the south for the first time after segregation and seeing the ropes down that separated the blacks from the whites and how it made them all feel being from the south to witness this event, it looses a lot in the translation of the essence of partnership.

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A portrait of manic, unstoppable passion Opera lover and mad dreamer Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald (Klaus Kinski) decides to moves a steamship overland from one river to another as part of a scheme to build an opera house in a remote part of the rain forest for Enrico Caruso to perform in. He is charismatic and enthusiastic in the beginning, passionately advocating his plans to various potential backers, all of whom turn him down. He is undeterred, as is director Werner Herzog, who matched his character's insane passion by actually transporting a steamship via block and tackle during the making of this film. The result is long and loosely structured but often hypnotic, another Herzog portrait of the frightening power of the human will to overcome all obstacles, even when its object is completely foolhardy. Nobody embodies that mania better than Kinski."

I usually switch to the new battery right before I use it and then place the other one on the charger. That keeps one fully charge and ready to go when I need it. It's a lot lighter and quieter than a gas powered trimmer and I appreciate not having one more thing to keep full of gas.It's not for large yards and heavy duty trimming, but if you just need something that does good enough and lasts then this is the trimmer for you."

I've been residing in the country for over a year and really was helped by all of the guidebooks I read about living here including ""Living Overseas"". However after much trial and error I have reached the conclusion that one person can't live on a budget of $1,000 monthly and have any kind of a decent lifestyle. It is impossible for a couple to live on said amount as the author claims on the back cover of this book. With their rent they would have to survive on $100 per week.

The reason I only gave this book 4 stars is because of out of the 5 Edith Nesbit Books I have read so far...this is my least favourite. I think it is beacuase of how it is written. It, to me, was lacking something all the other books she wrote have. I also did not particularly enjoy the beginning of the book, as it started out dull etc. But as it went on...I fell in love with the four children. One thing that is very evident in this book is the thing of good magic. Evrything thing seems to be filled with it, therefore making the story all the better and all more exciting. I loved how it showed each of there adventures, and each of there luck with the magic ring. I also got a few laughs out of the children's injinuity. This is truly a classic, but not my favourite Nesbit book. It certainly is worth getting though."

The book is fairly short and so intriguing that I found I had finished it much sooner that I hoped!The plot is full of twists so that I never saw the ending in its entirety until the final chapter, but I never felt like the book relied on absurd jumps to hide the solution.Also, the book was written a while ago, and the language and style reflect that. Some stock scenes are used and cliches are bandied about (like the climatic scene!) but I found this more charming then worn out!"

The emotion, passion, and soul integrated in every note he sings is powerful. Amongst my favorite cuts are U2's MLK/I Still Haven't Found and the original compositons written by Colm himself.

Basically what you have is a Killer, a young Policeman with a high pitched ringing in his Ears which frankly had me mute the film a couple of times and a long drawn out investigation that leads nowhere!

Plus you can hire a few people (janitors and security I believe) and that's about it. It's boring, the graphics are horrible and its a waste of money.

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Good But Could Have Been Better Don't get me wrong: Noonan has written another good book, just not as good as her book on Reagan. It's still worth reading because she shares the genuine love and affection many of us feel for John Paul the Great. But she drops the ball in chapter eleven where she tries to deal with the alleged lapses of the pontificate of JPG. She asserts that the liturgy got dumbed down during the watch of JPG--that's clearly wrong: the liturgy was already reeling well before 1978 when JPG became Pope. As to the sex abuse scandals, we get more heat than logic. Fortunately, our current Pope is already applying logical solutions such as the recent document barring homosexuals from ordination. The book is good, but it has its limits. Overlook the limits and enjoy her reminiscences about our common spiritual father. May he rest in peace!"

As a collector of art photography, I am, naturally, interested in young, up-and-coming photographers and their work. I saw a published photograph by Andrea Modica, found out that she lived and worked in upstate New York relatively near me, and then, a short time later, saw this wonderful paperbound collection in the Smithsonian bookshop. These black and white, almost classically composed, portraits of minor league players are brilliant character studies which constantly surprise the viewer. They show friendship and athleticism, a competitive spirit and, yes, eroticism. They are magnificent. Strangely enough, the highly informative interview with the photographer is uncredited. If you are interested in photography and/or baseball, you owe it to yourself to buy this book."

That is a virtue, in the sense of providing the reader with a wide variety of material. It also is a weakness, in that highly reputable scientists are implicitly equated with flakes. The author should have drawn a sharper distinction between those he took seriously and those he found ridiculous. The net effect is to introduce a giggle factor into our views of anyone who finds the external universe fascinating and relevant to our future.Achenbach is a bit too worshipful toward Carl Sagan and former NASA Administrator Dan Goldin.

This was a colossal waste of time in an otherwise excellent product. It could easily be fixed in the 2006 software if turbotax 1) switched the defaults to the users' previously-inputted values (CompleteTax does this and it seems like an obvious thing to do) and/or made it easy to navigate to a prior page by giving a link to every input page when a user clicks a superior tab or link.

This movie has some great action scenes, especially the ones where Abe uses that famous cherry tree ax to take out vampires.If you're looking to see a movie that is really very well written and keeps you engrossed from start to finish, definitely get this movie. Also, I did not purchase the HD version but regular Amazon instant video and the movie is still amazing!Final thoughts, this is really just a great movie with great actors. A must see for honest Abe fans!"

Second of all, maybe I was confused by the advertising, but it doesn't work quite like I expected it. Only about 40% of the time does the pimple just ""disappear"" and heal. The other 60%, the zeno just makes it come to a head a lot quicker so it can be extracted. It does really help with the swelling, and accelerates the healing process, but I usually find it takes at least four treatments for one pimple. With a 60-count cartridge, that's enough treatments for only 15 pimples. And the treatment heads/cartridges are way too expensive!"

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","HIDDEN DANGER!!! This is a durable and detailed action figure, however there is hidden danger in the gargoyle accessory. My 4 1/2 year old came to me screaming while holding his pinched finger. I did not know what he meant when he said his toy hurt him until I pressed the gargoyle recoil button. It was then that the excessive recoil action caused the clasp on the end of the cable to pop me on my fingertip. Since it was painful to me I know it would be painful to a youngster. If the action figure is not attached to the end of the cable, there is a dangerous whipping action from the rapid recoil. As my son and then I found out this whipping action can be painful, but perhaps more of a concern would be a serious injury that could happen if this occured to close to the face. This is probably the only concern with an otherwise fun toy."

I didnt plan on doing that as we used our other bouncer for a much longer time with our first daughter.With this bouncer my daughter was 5 or 6 months old and we looked down and she was hanging upside down at the side. The problem is that the straps that hold the baby in are anchored at the center and the baby can shift their weight and lean to one side. My other bouncer had a tight fitting velcro strap across the whole front which prevented her from leaning and falling off.Fisher price refunded my money once I told them about the problem.

Guess what? flat pieces don't fit in round sockets! In trying to force the wire onto the connector, I broke the electrode. Cost to replace? US$12.94. The warranty does not cover parts damaged during setup.Keep in mind, I'm usually pretty good at these kind of projects.

I love the lining on the inside of the comforter - it feels like a nice, soft sheet. And of course, the microsuede is so luxurious and soft! I like, too, that the comforter isn't too, too thick. It's just thick enough to feel warm, but not so thick that you're suffocating. I think we'll be able to use it all year if we want to. We bought a set of chocolate-colored sheets to go with it, and it's gorgeous. I think tan sheets would look nice, too."

The movie ends up being I think, life affirming and optimistic (without being sentimental).The young actors do a fantastic job, and it is an empathy for their characters that makes this an enjoyable film. Matthias Schweighofer does a great job as `Crash'. Jessica Schwartz is wonderful, she was a very brave young woman to do a nude sex scene whilst nearly 9 months pregnant. Jessica was also the prostitute, killed for her sent in the movie `Perfume'. So, this is a bit strange and quirky, and it didn't work for me all the way through, but I thought it was memorable"

Still, it's mind boggling.Sometimes, the characters aren't formally introduced, they just seem to jump in. Also, it's too jumpy, from one scene to another.

This book is interesting! It contains almost no technical material (aside from the optional appendices), and pure mathematics is surprisingly fascinating; not being a number theorist i appreciated the many references it has to the practical implications of maths, but there are also some noodle-baking moments concerning ideas that are so very simple, yet totally strange.Third.

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Disappointed This is an exciting story that plays very well on HBO, but in book form, falls short and is frustrating. The book is broken into quasi-chapters about each character done in chronological order. This is fine, but Mr. Martin likes to end each chapter with a cliff-hanger going on to another character's story. It is very disjointed, and frustrates me because I have to wait so long to return and resolve the original cliffhanger. The pacing and chronology is very frustrating. Just when I care about what is going to happen next, I'm taken to another place and time. In a shorter novel, this may work, but in a 1000+ page book this reader becomes quite frustrated.Rather than move on to the next book, I think I'll wait for the HBO adaption, which follows the novel quite closely."

There is something unusual in this book in terms of plot and the idiosyncrasies of the characters involved.

Aryeh is involved in the misfortunes of all characters as an outsider, an a spectator. When reaching his coming of age, he secluded himself from the rest of the world in order to settle the confusion in his mind, life, and world.

Sour Puss is a HUGE disappointment. What made the previous books in the series so delightful was the wonderful animals, of course, but also, the portrait of small-town life in Crozet, populated with fascinating characters. Sour Puss is a complete departure from the rest of the series. While we still get some charming scenes with the animal protagonists, the humans are one-dimensional. The book is one long lecture after another on Ms. Brown's political views, vineyards, bioterrorism, and Ms. Brown's increasingly elitist economic views. The book seems obsessed with wealth. Now that ""Harry"" has remarried and left the Post Office, perhaps this series needs to be retired.

This takes away some of the realism with respect to weapon use.I find the last mission VERY difficult to complete, I've reached the last part of it and having a heck of a time completing it, and I am on the ""easy"" mode!!....If you have patience...you will like this game!"

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A Sense of Perspective After reading several of the reviews on here, I felt compelled to put in my two cents' worth. A number of the people that disliked these stories did so because they found the computer science in this ""dated"" -- well, of course it is, these stories are over 50 years old. Computers then were huge monsters that took up entire floors of buildings and didn't have the processing power of the PC I'm using to write this note on. No one then foresaw the coming explosion of processing power and availability of computers to the ""common man"" that would occur about 30 years down the road. So try to keep that in mind when you read these stories. It's like Jules Verne writing of going to the moon back when hot air balloons were about the only way of getting man off the ground."

I truly enjoyed reading the book. This wasn't the typical Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll diary that you usually get from musicians. Jake's tales are very amusing and his writing makes you feel like you a right there with him through the ups and downs. I was never a big Semisonic fan when they first hit it big, but I went out and bought all 3 of their CDs after finishing the book. It was interesting listening to each CD knowing the stories behind the recordings. You don't need to be a Semisonic fan to enjoy this book, but you probably will be one by the end of it."

I read this book after my sister had purchased it and asked for my opinion. I found the book to feel oversimplified and sort of biased - in the sense that in many cases the author implies that he knows something that your doctor does not (whereas there was not any ""news"" in here for the average North American MD). In my opinion, much of the information presented, while perhaps interesting, so far underrepresents the currently-known ""whole truth"" that it may mislead the layperson into believing that exercise and nutrition can solve all of one's ails.I am also not a fan of the ""Dummies""-like style and layout.The communication level seems appropriate for a teenager.Certainly, this is a reasonable primer but I do not recommend this book as a loner on one's home medical bookshelf since it omits so much explanation and truth (and conflicting evidence in some cases!) to further the author's dramatically simple agenda."

I'm sure there are plenty of fanatics out there that wouldn't mind paying the extra cost for it. I know I'd pay. I guess since it's a different kind of 3-D technology it may be harder to put into DVD format, but I will keep my fingers crossed."

It is impressive for several reasons.* Original screenplay.* Well done cinematography* Better than average acting* Decent musical scoreThis film is very memorable and fun to watch. The gore is not over the top. For a low budget work, it comes off as costing far more. The Nazi zombies have a measurable cruel streak. It makes them very interesting. The characters are not very likable, but this seems to have been done on purpose. The film builds slowly and it is a very long time before we see any zombies. They are introduced in a very creepy fashion, and the originality of the film takes off from this point. All in all, OUTPOST is a very good addition to the Nazi zombie genre."

Took like 10 min. I know it's hard to understand what I'm talking about, but once you get it you will understand. After I got rid of these tabs it worked fine.

Does he really believe that God or ""Ka"" gives him the ability to write and dictates when he can or can't? That was absurd. Secondly, stay out of the book. I wasn't reading these books to find out a biography of your life and divine purpose in creating this story. I don't really care about the ending being a loop and I actually wish the other 4 didn't get to end up fat'n'happy together. I just wish King would stay out of his story.

Some of the values are good, but some are overly simplistic. Sperry telling Dustin that the bully must have a hard time in life without a father, while not acknowledging Dustin's lack of a father - rather blew me away. Also the Bible is quite clear there is a time to fight (Proverbs, David & Goliath, ect...). Some of the situations are awkward and unrealistic - Dustin and the girl he likes - it turns into a witnessing thing instead of what could have been a *Godly* friendship (it is normal for a boy to ask a girl out)! Lastly, the rosy ending where all the kids turn into Christian doctors, lawyers, biologists, astronauts, ect...just killed it for me.

The updated version of Stevie Wonder's Heaven is 10 zillion light years aways sounds like a Mr. Mister song because Pat Mastelotto does the drums and Steve Farris did the gutiar.

So what you get are interviews and comedy sketches, and maybe a song or two from Dean. The earlier ""best of"" series was much better as it focused on the musical numbers. Another missing element are ""Dean's Girls""--- the Golddiggers and the Dingaling Sisters. Since they did mainly musical numbers (their own or as backups for guest stars), they have been cut from the episodes except for when they do introductions.

David Garland challenges any romanticised pre-conceptions that the reader may have about the crucifixion and explores without apology the uncomfortable things about this gospel: the total failure of the disciples, that Jesus' last recorded words are ""My God my God why have you forsaken me?"" and the lack of appearance of the risen Christ (he stops at 16:8).

Some of the ""druid training"" scenes are quite beautiful with very creative direction to attain subtle effects which nicely contrast the Warlock's macabre magic.As I said before the story is a little silly but I liked it better than the witch-hunter sent through time story of the first film and the forgettable kids in a haunted house approach of the third."

This is a great story that uses American historical figures and heroes as the source of most of the characters, which gives it familiarity but also thoroughly develops their character from what we know from history and attempts to predict what they would have done in this situation. I was wishing the story would continue at the end."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","How many more pages?? While Dr. David Elkind is a respected name in the Child Psychology arena, I found that anything of value or knowledge that he presented in The Hurried Child is merely common sense. It scares me to think that there are actually people out in this world, reproducing, who need to read this book.Dr. Elkind expressed some valid points on the general ""rush of society"" - our tendency to saddle our children with competition in the adult world, but nothing that needed 221 pages of interpretation. Dr. Elkind takes an extremist position on his point of view throughout the book. Despite the books' attempts at valuable lessons, they are dissected into such meaningless pieces that any cohesive lesson is lost. The reality is we are living in a rapidly changing society, and individuals need to do their best to strive at an individual pace to attain what they perceive as success."

Some of the pages are strange Like a diagram of the teeth where you are supposed to write when they got them... Teeth are a long process not very well described by dates. Small things like that. If you buy a baby book be sure to be able to look inside.

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Why is Ludachris so mad? I love the current state of radio in that I get all of my favorite songs played every hour so I never stop hearing them. So I hear, ""Get Back"" by Loodakwis and he's talking about how he is going to beat up somebody. Why? I have a big problem with hip hop culture right now in that it portrays women pretty much as strippers who just need to dance up on their man, who needs to be a soljah. Why all the violence? I'm a big fan of old school rap like Whodini, Twinkie T and EPMD. They didn't constantly talk about beating up people and degrading women and they were seven point eight times the rappers that Lewdachris is. I just don't like the way things are going and I think we're in for trouble unless things get back to the way they were when Dj Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince owned the rap game. Out."

I considered purchasing an apple ipod classic and came across the zune price drops and figured it was too hard not to take a chance on the zune. As a father of two I purchased it out of practicality, including price and not media hype or coolness factor. I bought it mostly for music storage and pictures. My greatest concerns prior to purchasing were ease of use, functionality and battery life. My only disappointment is battery life. I average five hours which seems lousy to me. The zune requires its own software, similar to itunes with an upgrade that is pending. Right now the music or only availabe option on the zune marketplace is pretty good, but falls a bit short compared to itunes. However, its easy to use. The zune itself is easy to use and the screen is nice and pretty large. My only real disppointment is the current lack of videos for purchase on the zune marketplace and the short battery life."

The truck breaks down in the middle of nowhere, which happens to be where they find hitchhiker Orlie, played by Jon Heder, who, let's face it, should play Napoleon Dynamite in every movie he's in. They subsequently ditch Orlie, run out of gas, visit Rick's parent's, have the truck stolen by ""The Lady"" (Billy Drago), and get into a cage match death fight. Of course Rick falls for Michelle, and blah, blah, blah. There wasn't a single likeable character in this movie, which naturally made it difficult to enjoy."

This was a slow paced book and the plot was hard to follow at first. I found the character development weak and it was hard to keep all of the characters straight through to the end of the book. I enjoyed the main character Queenie and the themes of friendship and quilting.

Unfortunately when it came in, it was only the adapter. My fault, I guess I didn't read the fine print. Ended up paying shipping and then having to go buy the soft ring to go with it. To add salt to the wound, the local RV place had the complete set for $12.99. I spent $20 with shipping and purchasing the soft sewer ring seperate. Haven't used the item yet, but I think it will be perfect for our pop up camper. I rigged the Shower and Sink drain together and will use this to hook to the camp ground sewer."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Round and round the story goes, where it will stop nobody knows... Wow, what a long read for such a short story. This book was packed with french history and rich descriptions of some truly remarkable landmarks. However, the story really had no beginning middle and end. It ended quite randomly. There were so many misunderstandings and back and forth drama that I was thoroughly bored. The characters were likable but not memorable. The book could have ended 50% of the way through as a novella and would have been more than enough. If you like to read books that are long merely for the sake of being long then this is the book for you. However, if you like a story that engages and draws to a well sought out conclusion you would do better to read something else."

It is definitely a refurb, it came pretty beat-up scuffs, scrapes and dings, more than I expected for a refurb. The cutoff attachemnt being the most beat up. All the parts came (for me) in a large tool bag. So far it works well, when I got it there were 2 or 3 bent and damaged washers in the bottom of the bag, I was worried these were pieces of the unit, but haven't had any issues yet. If you don't mind that it may not be pretty, then it is well worth the price."

Although I am not that big of a fan of medieval type of films or tv shows, I simply fell in love with this series. The first episode was ok, and was a bit too complex for me at first. A few days later, I gave it another try, and I couldn't stop watching after that. I really got involved with the characters, especially, and the story as well. It's like a roller coaster ride, it plays so well with your emotions.This is not your conventional TV show where you kinda know what is going to happen next. This show keeps you on your toes, and you cannot predict what's going to happen next. Also the attention to the detail of the costumes, scenery, and even plot really makes this show into something special.If I could recommend any show in the world, I would recommend anyone to watch this."

After an adequate if a little bland debut album, i expected and anticipated great things from Lifehouse. Although second albums are known to be difficult, i beleived the band to have promise. How wrong was I.There is not a single song on here that lives up to the standard of any of those on 'No Name Face'. Its all highly irritating, mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless. I have a very varied taste in music and I do know a melody when it comes my way, but there is no melody on this album worth writing about.I write this to stop others making the same mistake I did, and if you like Lifehouse because of 'No Name Face', trust me stay away from this so you still have some love for the band.Switchfoot, Vertical Horizon, Jimmy Eat World even the Calling(whose album I also think suffers from having only one good song on it but is still better than this drivel) are in a class of their own when compared to Lifehouse im afraid. Spend your money and time elsewhere."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","overhyped I am at a loss to understand the glowing reviews rendered by The NY TImes and other publications. When the narrative directly involves Father Joe, it is engaging and insightful. But a great deal of time is spent detailing the relatively uninteresting early adulthood foibles of the author. Admittedly, his writing is eloquent and he includes some eye-opening accounts (among others, Jerry Lewis does not fare too well!), but I would guess that I am not alone in being uninterested in his agonizingly indepth exploration of National Lampoon Magazine and a British television show populated with puppets.I would have preferred a more concise portrait of Father Joe and a less detailed recitation on the life of Tony Hendra. In this book, called 'Father Joe', the title character makes far too little of an appearance."
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Disappointing film The title of the film and the cast would seem to portend a fun and interesting movie. Alas, this is not the case. The story line is such an over-used one, with quirky patches, and the acting is barely adequate. What a waste of such a talent as Scott Thompson. I was disappointed in the film from beginning to end and actually had to almost discipline myself to watch it to the end, since I had purchased it. After considering it, I later decided to watch it again, and my reaction hadn't changed, but knowing what was coming seemed to make the movie even more insipid."

I had the money but decided to buy beer with it. It still stings (but not as bad since you can get anything on Amazon now) The hunter doesn't hunt for the kill he hunts for the hunt. The Baio/Ames comedy tandem rivals Akroyd/Belushi in terms of comic timing and hilarity. One of my all-time favorite scenes is in this moving with an under the influence Scattman Crothers and some sort of gun that fires hot dogs or baloney (can't remember)

When there is a sea of pink flags in the backyard it's time for my son to go clean 'em up. It goes so much faster & he doesn't complain as much. My neighbor even likes them because she can see where the messes are and knows not to park the car to close to them so her kids won't step in them. I am hoping they will make cleanup in the winter snow easier & faster too. Only problems I have had are they rusted with all the rain and are easy to bend if the ground is too hard.

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","It should have been so much better Although a fair attempt to get inside the mindset of G.A.C., this book ultimately fails to deliver the thrills or tension it should have. The biggest downer is that this was written by the author of the excellent 'Dances with Wolves'. As a fictional account of Custer's diary, the book is tied by the fact that there is no reference to the Battle of the Little Big Horn and this also leaves the reader with a sense of unfinished business. Rumours are that the screen rights for this book have been bought by Oliver Stone. I would recommend Oliver and any other interested reader to acquire 'A road we do not know'. It's a far more exciting read."

I've read most of the Uncle John's books, and enjoy them. This is by far my least favorite. The writing is mostly fluff, not succinct like other Uncle John's books. The writer tries to be humorous, but in my opinion fails. Let the story provide the humor. Articles end three quarters down the page or near the top of the next page, then another starts on the following page. This gives the impression that they're padding the book to make it longer/thicker. If this had been my first Uncle John book I doubt I would have bought so many others. Thankfully the others are so much better! Think twice about buying this book. Perhaps review it at a local bookstore first."

But this one is distinct and unique. Weak and Powerless is a powerful song, and Gravity is quickly becoming one of my favorite if not my favorite track.

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Yummy seconds (or thirds if that's how you see it) I really liked this book. The ending (I won't spoil it for you) I didn't exspect. It wasn't as creepy as 'Silence' but just as gory, if not more so. It was about Dr. Lecter after he escaped (6 years after). It tells the story of Manson Verger, a man he mamnied years prior to 'Silence.' Clairece is back, along with Barney and Jack Crawford. A few scenes were interestingly unpredictable but the rest of the novel follows Harris's stream of historical interest. If you enjoyed 'The Silence of the Lambs' and Lecters and Starlings twisted relationship (like me) you'll enjoy the book. Worth buying, if you do."

One of the drawbacks is the lack of a code for common DVR/VCR combos, but I just used the learning function to copy the most important buttons for that, the amp, the TVs and the other VCR.

If I recall it has several songs from that album: The Race is On, Honky Tonk Downstairs, Almost Persuaded and the title track. 18 songs total sound quality is as good as vinyl. The one drawback is I really don't want to hear George Jones sing Okie from Muskogee, Fightin Side of Me or Hello Darlin. Truckstop Quality is to say if you were on a cross country roadtrip withdrawling from caffeine, CD's in the car on their second time round this would be a great pickup for the price when you stopped for coffee."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",Disappointed! I am a huge Stargate fan I have watched this since it first aired on Sho time. I have all the seasons on dvd including this one. I decided to check it out even though I saw some poor reviews. I have to say that I did NOT like it. The important parts in the first movie were taken out and it left unanswered questions. I did not care about the nudity taken out because you still could understand what was happening but other scenes that were cut really took away from the film. If the idea was to get more money out of the fans then I guess they did that. I wish I never wasted my money!!
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Fun, frothy read Since I'm a yoga fan living in New York, this book was an obvious choice for me. But I'm confident that most chick lit fans would enjoy it.The main characters are Lisa (our narrator), Isla (a six-foot-tall Spanish model), Susan (the gentle, spacey wife of a wealthy Wall Street businessman), Gigi (the tough-talking Queens native) and Margaret (a humorless lawyer). I liked Margaret the least, until she started showing her soft side. All the other characters are enjoyable and interesting.They might seem to have nothing in common, but they're all pregnant and all enrolled in yoga class at Hasharama, a trendy (fictitious) SoHo studio. Each woman has a secret, except the narrator.This is a fun read about the ups and downs of pregnancy, raising a baby, immersing yourself in yoga, friendship and men. The plot stretches credulity toward the end (I won't spoil the surprise) but this bubbly, crisply-written book is the perfect summer read."
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Not your typical missionary tale All stories based in Africa deal with survival under extreme conditions (war, drought, floods, famine, disease, and infestations).This novel, however, is about overcoming the challenges that we find within ourselves. The extreme conditions of African village life are simply a backdrop to the internal struggles of a missionary family, the Price family, as each is transformed forever by the experience of life in Africa."
5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","One of the best games I've played This was a truly awesome game. One of the major highlights is a destructible environment. Almost everything (see cons) is destructible. Also, the game keeps the destruction until you quit. The plot is pretty good, as are SOME of the lines (a few were extremely good). In addition, since the players are mercs, you can work for almost any company/ organization. Overall, this is definitely a five star game at a great price.Cons:Rocks can't be destroyed, even by tanks/C4in-game tutorial (directions and such) repeat every time the game startsCan't keep vehicles between playing seasons"

The LED light is very different from the traditional flashlights and may not be what you expect. The light is not focused. Used outdoors, the diffuse light will illuminate I found relatively good up to only about 30 feet. The beam cannot be focused from a diffuse pattern to a sharp compact beam.

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Dated material What a let down this album is. It took 10 years for another great singer to release a new album. An album filled with painfully dated material. Anita does what she does best with her heavy but sultry singing. But the problem here is that she has been stuck in a time capsule since 1994. It's as almost as if nothing has inspired her over the past decade to try something different or experimental for the 21st century. Not that she's required to do so. But sometimes, the best quality of an artist is his or her ability to grow and change into different aspects of thier sound and style. Here, Anita just doesn't do this.Honestly, if you want to hear this new album from Anita, your better off saving your money and just rotate what you already have in your Anita collection."

That is incredible. And, I do mean incredible. Unfortunatley, even that DVD has a flaw, the concert footage is broken up by interviews, and the song Voodoo is trampled on by interviews.If this Live DVD had the sound quality of the Changes DVD, it would be one of the best concert films ever.

I feel like a lucky voyeur to be able to listen to such divinely inspired songs from the daily lives of generations of Cuban farmers."

As far as ""Choose your own adventure"" books go, this was so-so to me:---Characters---I didn't like how the characters Matt and Milma were not very well developed, thus making me not care about going on an adventure with them. I don't think it would have mattered if they were with the reader or not.Haven was decently developed.---Artwork---Horrible. Painful to look at.---Story---Not horrible, but not great either. There wasn't a single scene that was memorable.---Conclusion---This is one book I doubt I will ever read again. At least for me, a book without a single memorable scene is not worth reading (unless I am big time bored)."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Nice, but hardly new Why do so many critics focus on a singer's race rather than his music? Is it multiculturalism or simply racism? Whatever the reason, Marc Anthony has released a CD of standard adult contemporary music that's very pleasant, very romantic, but hardly ground-breaking. If he were white or African-American, this CD probably wouldn't have garnered a lot of attention. But because Latin music is the flavor of the month, performers like Anthony are getting a lot more press than they really deserve. A nice album - nothing more."

Once you find what you want to make, you have to flip back to the pastry part of the recipe. Then you have to find the cooking directions for the pastry. Then you flip back to the item you want to bake. Sometimes, in the course of that recipe, it says to use a particular technique and refers to another page. I made a pecan tart with wonderful results (and many compliments), but had to find information in no fewer than four different parts of the book to accomplish this. This book is only for people who are very good readers who follow directions well and are not easily discouraged."

The CGI during that scene is laughable). It's a slow moving movie, and their are some real cheesy scenes.

Trade routes cannot be developed without constructing a road to the others capital. And if trade is purely based upon resources, then insufficient resources are available early in the game.

Unfortunately for some reason that I cannot understand this one is not a blues album, but a sort of soul-pop-rock (with a hint of blues) - radio friendly, kind of music that is just not my favourite gender.

Thanks to the bull's-eye A&R talents of RCA chief Clive Davis and a cast of grade-A songwriters-including Cathy Dennis, Desmond Child, Kara DioGuardi, Gary Burr, Steve Morales, Andreas Carlsson-the ""American Idol"" hero's debut album perfectly matches his radiantly melodramatic voice with good, old-fashioned power ballads aimed straight for the gods. Throughout, the timeless production focuses squarely on Aiken's immense talent. ""Run to Me"" is arguably the sweet spot, the quintessential tear-jerker, along with show-stoppers ""No More Sad Songs,"" ""I Survived You"" and the title track. In another radio era, this album could be the ""Thriller"" of the day, spawning hit after hit. In any case, fans have plenty to celebrate.

I will buy no more products from Amazon unless I have heard the specific recording. But I have spent $17 and am unable to return the product which I will now seldom listen to."
5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Animal hospital for kids who have pets I bought this as a Christmas gift for my godchild who will turn 4 in March. She is very interested in animals and has already expressed a desire to be a vet. Admittedly I am a little biased but I think she is a very intelligent child and she loves the animal hospital. She had to get every piece out and examine it immediately upon opening it. I think this would be a very good experience for any child who is interested in animals. It allows them to see some of the instuments that a vet would use and they can set up their own little office. This is not to be used to treat real, live animals though. There are lots of pieces in the set so if you have a child who gets frustrated easily or has trouble keeping track of lots of pieces, this probably would not be a good selection for them."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Beware, check further also... Only three stars, not to belittle this obviously loved and excellent recording. I HIGHLY recommend that you also check out other great recordings as the differences are enormous. The great Reiner CSO version from the fifties has been in my head for 40 plus years. Upon hearing the Kubelik version I was shocked at the great difference in tempo. The Kubelik is MUCH slower than the Reiner! Seriously, the first minute of the Kubelik is covered in 40 seconds of the Reiner. I am no music professor and I am not trying to say what is superior, ultimately it is a question of taste and preference, (and probably a little bias in my case) but with this level of variety in performances, please check out the other major recordings available of this great work."

It feels sturdy in the hand, and the adjustable speed control is great. My only ding against it is that there's no way to keep the power running except to hold in the power switch. The switch is long and designed to comfortably be operated by hands of any size; but instead of clicking on and off when you press it, you have to hold the switch in by clenching your hand to keep it running. When you're taking a minute or more to puree a soup, for instance, that gets very tiring. It seems like an unnecessary design flaw; it could just as easily toggle on/off using the same switch. I hope that will be recognized and changed in the future. Other than that, it's great."

It depends on where he blocks himself.2-Player mode has the same setup, except that it's you're friend that you are facing.Oh yeah, and watch out for police. Who knows what they'll do if you get caught?When you win, I just find the scene to be funny, since someone from the building you're in front of cheers for your victory.Overall, it's a stellar fighting game that you might want to try out.

The Star Spangled Banner is a wimpy electric piano, and there are several ""songs"" that are read scripts that really sound like a poor copy of what you might find at a theme parks story of the US Presidents. At about the time you are ready to slit your wrist ""America the Beautiful"" comes along and you think that this isn't the worst you have ever heard. Convoy, the next song... is the worst. Fanfare is OK but get the real version from Boston Pops (Williams) America the Dream goes on or Telarc's American Jubilee (Kunzel)Over all a complete dissapointment!"
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",great toy for hours of fun when I bought this toy I had no idea it would be such a big hit for my 3 year old. She has not put it down for 3 days. She has taken it everywhere. I love it because it is only water and so it can't mess anything up. My only complaint is that it won't last. It is holding up now but because it is made with cardboard backing it can't take the water forever. When I compair it with a color book or other art item it is worth it because they keep on doing it over and over. And it lasts about as long. If your going on a trip or something and you need a project to do on a plane or in a car. I highly recomend buying this item.

I loved Grits' last album, especially the songs ""be mine"" ""ooh aah"" ""believe"" and ""lovechild.""Its definately way different than I was hoping it would be. It seems that they changed their focus of culture. This album seems to be directed deep inner city... not my style, whereas ""The Art of Translation"" seemed to be more on the pop, hip-hop end.The music video that comes on the CD is all about the STUFF that Grits owns... they cruise around in Vegas and flash their spinners... necklaces... i got a question... where's God in all of this?Well its only like $13... the choice is yours."

I had never read anything by either of the authors before, but had heard so many good things about both that I found myself continually surprised at how bad the writing was, and how cardboard the characters were. I didn't care about any of them. It's really hard to feel for any character when none of them seem developed enough for you to care whether they live or die. I guess I see how this could be suspenseful for someone who's never read a suspense novel before, but I couldn't even finish, because it felt like a waste of my time. Sorry authors.

I won't give any of the good stuff away, but in this show, you will see things that appeared in Star Trak, Star Wars, etc.It is wonderful to relive an important part of my childhood, while at the same time, realizing that so much created for this series was borrowed by other more recent shows. This should definitely be part of any Sci-Fi fan's collection."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","THE GAME'S AFOOT A 1982 tv movie has resurfaced, showing us that yes, Tom Hanks was a very young man when he was making his first movies and tv series. Sadly enough, this movie is dull and pretty uninvolving. It tells the story of four college students who play a game called Mazes and Monsters, which ultimately results in Hanks' losing his focus on what is and isn't real. There's no real suspense and the dialogue just panders along without any real crucial meat to it. Hanks shows a spark of what was to come, but even he can't rescue this one. Add a young Wendy Crewson (SANTA CLAUSE MOVIES, THE JOANNE KILBOURNE MYSTERIES), Chris Makepeace (MY BODYGUARD) and cames from some well known supporting players: Vera Miles, Anne Francis, Lloyd Bochner, Murray Hamilton, Peter Donat, Louise Sorel and Susan Strasberg, and you have a competent cast in a sorely developed storyline. Author Rona Jaffe's book may have been interesting, but this movie sure isn't."

Part of what makes it so is the heightened reality of its situations. This reader was always there with the cast of characters, sharing in all the action. The people we meet are all so very real. Even though our heroine, Rebecca, is a world-class concert pianist, she's very accessible and easy to fall in love with. Likewise with Horne, her ultimate hero - larger than life and there to identify with. The background of hate groups, so prevalent in today's world, produces the filthiest bunch of neo-Nazis you're ever likely to meet. Early on they commit a serious error by murdering Rebecca's sister on the eve of her wedding (part of a master plan to kill Jewish brides.) Rebecca schemes to get Horne, the ex-lion hunter to join her in tracking down the killers and we move forward from there. The unpredictable plot twists and turns are ever fascinating right up to the rip-roaring finale. This was one great read!"

Sure, there are a couple of quirky moments here, yet the plot is substandart, the directing is weak, the characters are not likable in the least and the acting shows signs of competence still isn`t all that great either. Overall, this effort is a mildly enjoyable cinematic experience that`s probably worth watching once if there`s nothing better around. Decent and tolerable, but a classic this is not.Passable entertainment."

Like in RE:Survivor, it takes place on an island, which kind of takes the fun out of it. I think you should be able to explore more of Racoon City, throw in some new enemys. This game just bored me. In this game, you just kill zombies, which is the jist of the game. But, unlike RE 1, 2, and 3, it felt obscure.

This may be good only if you're shooting mostly outdoors during the day, but don't expect to bring it to a party, club, or out on the town at night.

As usual, the plot is rehashed with Kolchak (Darren McGavin) chasing some supernatural villian, while the cops do their Keystone imitation and Vincienzo (Simon Oakland)screams at the top of his lungs.Apparently ""Night Strangler"" was made with a low budget; the production was mostly filmed on a set and shows it. (In contrast, ""Night Stalker"" was filmed on location in Las Vegas and looks great.) The fight sequence between the cops and the villian looks so bad; I've seen more realistic fights at a WWF event.The villian is less frightening than in the first movie, probably because you never see him in anything but a trenchcoat and hat, and never get the impression that there's something supernatural about him.If you want to be scared, get the first Kolchak movie (five stars) instead and avoid this one."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Great Workout, but not really for beginners. I have been using this tape for almost a year now and I love it. However, it does have a few problems. Ms. Steele does not adequately explain the correct stances you are supposed to use. If I had not already taken tae-kwon-do and known the basic moves, I think I would have had great difficulty figuring out the correct moves. Also, she continually instructs you to fully extend your arms and legs and to lock your legs when you are doing the various kickboxing moves. I have always been taught that locking your legs and arms when exercising will lead to injury. Since I already know how to exercise correctly, I know when to ignore such questionable advice when doing the tape. But someone who is not familiar with exercising and how to avoid injury might have a problem with this tape. If you already know kickboxing and how to exercise without injuring yourself, this is a good workout."

I agree with other reviewers' sentiment about the lack of attention given to this carrying case. The Canon S70 is a High-End Point-and-Shoot. Canon should make a case that is as well-thought as their Canon S60/S70 cameras. What irks me is that they do(!). However, it is NOT SOLD IN THE USA! Do a Google search for ""Canon SC-PS900"". The SC-PS900 Canon Camera Case is well-padded and has pockets for 2 Additional Compact Flash Cards and also for a Spare Battery (which is a necessity with this camera). I got mine on eBay. I wish I could have bought it on Amazon or any U.S. retailer. I'm not trying to be racist (as I'm Asian) but C'mon Canon - sell the SC-PS900 Case in the U.S. too!"

It's good when a movie gets you thinking and talking, and this one did, but it's not good when you have to think hmmm, I wonder how that movie ended and what happened to those people."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","The Lost Army Of Cambyses This book has a really great story line, but in my opinion it was not well written. I was more interested in the lost army of Cambyses and was disappointed to find that it was just a backdrop for the real story which had nothing to do with Cambyeses.The story line is difficult to follow at times and could have been developed better along more classic lines. The author chose to follow lines of thinking that, I believe, interfered with the story line and actually detracted from what could have been a truly great story. The sexual content that was added was sadistic and violent and detracted from the content of the story as well. It is too bad, because the story line was such, that it could have been a classic which could have been enjoyed by multitudes of readers for years to come had it been developed better."

It's definitely not a ""professional"" table by any means, but it was good enough for our purposes.

Ben Harper is today's Dylan, weaving social issues into his wide range of songs and subjects. The music is clear, sweet acoustic guitar riffs not clouded with too many noises or electric sounds. If you like soulful musics with real feeling from hope to pain and everything in between buy this. I could never listen to music with religious themes before, but Harper's tunes about piety, faith and love change that. He is sincere and deep like Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, with a smoother, simpler sound and less anger and confusion. Brings me that peaceful feeling when I listen."

The reason why I almost gave this album 5 stars is the J-ZONE produced track ""S.M.D."" Jesus, he kills that track with sick samples. and then Celph Titled rips it apart.

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A good multiplayer game This game is VERY fun when you play with two or more players. However, when it comes to single player, it falls short in many ways. While it IS fun to play adventure mode (a very cool mode where you can play in super mario style) it grows old very quickly, as you face the same type of enemies over and over. The ""Classic"" mode single player is simply to repetetive. Once you beat the classic mode with one of the characters, the rest of them are the same, as you face the same opponents every time. However, this game is VERY fun multiplayer. You can set it to timed mode, where you play for a certain amount of time (YOU CHOOSE!) or knockout (where you have a certain amount of lives). The only thing about multiplayer is you have to beat single player to get extra characters (see above info about single player). My conclusion about this game is that it deserves three stars, since you really cant fully enjoy it without at least two controllers."

What happened to Crash's trademark ""Woh!""? Speaking of dialogue, the current game has Crash going through puberty backwards, he seems more scronny, and has lost his touch. This just doesn't feel like a Crash game. Granted, Crash's usual formulla is a recycled version of Super Mario Bros., but it at least that worked. This just isn't a Crash game.

Instructions like ""adjust to get the desired effect"" mean nothing. If I see an example of the effect I like in the book I want to know EXACTLY how to do it and not be left to guess. It is not what I consider a step-by-step book and some of the instructions tell you to do something and assume you know what to do. If you are a beginner, stay away from this book.

This film is rather slow and deliberate at times, but that isn't a surprise considering that movies like '2001' were also made in this era. So 'Marooned' is to be valued as a realistic rarity in any decade. There were and ARE too few real space program films being made. If only Martin Caidin had written more things like 'Marooned'."

You'll never regret a visit to Libbiville."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Beautiful photographs, but.... This book contains some wonderfully ""art-y"" photographs, but it's more about the photographer than about the District of Columbia. If you are already familiar with the capital, you will probably enjoy the photographs, but it's not the book for you if you want a sort of tourist-oriented collection of prominent landmarks and vistas. Instead, the photos tend to be close-ups of a tiny corner of a building or monument; unless you read the photographer's notes, you will often not be able to identify what you are looking at. That being said, some of the photos are rather beautiful - this is a book for people interested in photography, not in tourism or reference. For the latter folks, I recommend Robert Cameron's ""Above Washington"" although it needs to be updated."

I've finished the books but not the series. His Arthur series was not to my liking. This series however, has changed all of that. This book was entertaining and enjoyable. I didn't get too wrapped up in trying to make his story fit my traditional understanding of the story because each author should be given the freedom to do their own interpretation. If you can handle that, buy this book, if you are some sort of traditionalist when it comes to story telling, then stay away from this one. Trying to piece together who fits where will drive you mad and take away from an excellently spun yarn."
5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","The Ultimate Paranoid Thriller There's the central character in this book, Matt Sinkage. He's a paranoid. Or not. He knows the truth about an extraterrestrial invasion, and he will fight each and every operative of the plan, despite the fact that he is... I better stop here. Poor Matt! He's going to be hunted by too many agents, private eyes, operatives, politicians and journalists, although he himself is a natural born hunter, and won't stop stalking at the enemies of mankind until the moment he would be able to end the whole invasion plan for good. Believe me, this is good stuff. Everything starts with ""Secret Affairs, Red Shadows"", follows up in ""Tarnished Dreams"" and has the perfect, unpredictable end in the last page of ""The Great Fear"". Anyone who was a fan of the ""Heavy Metal"" magazine back there in the eighties must go get this book at once (names that come to my head are Torres, Chaland, Serge Clerc). This story really fascinated me!"

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","X's review on Golden Sun I haven't gotten this game yet, but from what I've heard and seen, this is a must have for RPG lovers that have a Game Boy Advance. Great graphics for the GBA, a good story line, nice play control, and an overall great game. There are four characters that you can play as. The main character Isaac, who uses the power of Earth, Garet, who uses fire, Ivan, he uses wind, and Mia with water. These powers are called psynergy, and can be enhanced by small, magical creatures called Djinn (Djinni is singular), which can be found usually by solving puzzles. Djinn can also be used to summon magical creatures. Venus Djinn have the power of earth, Mars Djinn have the power of fire, Jupiter Djinn have the power of wind, and Mercury Djinn use water. I would choose a 94 from a scale of 1-100 for the overall game. I hope this review helped you in any way."

Also, the black color comes off easily with a Scotchbrite kitchen sponge (or even a damp cloth) and also scratches when you move pots on it.I've returned it to amazon and will get a replacement to see if there was something wrong with this batch of burner plates; another review here states the same problem, though, so I assume they'll warp again."

Occasionally we use the fax capability when our dedicated fax machine conks out. The D680 uses the same toner cartridge as the D780 and the newer D880. We have to replace the cartridge every month or two. The L50 cartridges can be expensive. We get ours from InfinityImaging.com or Provantage.com.

Most clock radios have numbers illuminated against a dark display. This one is reverse with the numbers dark and the entire rest of the (quite large) display illuminated shedding WAY too much light for a person to reasonably sleep with.We got this mainly as a sound machine for our daughter who also needs a very dark room to fall asleep, so we're either going to have to return this or jerry-rig something to go over the display to make it dimmer."

It seems to be well made and we put it on because it is to late to try and return and try a different size before winter. We have had some strong winds and it seems to be ok, moved a little but we will see.

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Revolution Revisited There are not many movies about the American Revolution. Beyond The Patriot, The Crossing and a few others, one has to search pretty hard to find a movie that encompasses both the political and military aspects. Revolution was made 25 years agao and does have that dated feeling with the musical score and camera angles, but the battle scenes and historical setting are as well done as if the movie were made today. It is a bit difficult to get past Al Pacuino in this role. You keep seeing Michael Corleon or some other NYC tough guy. Although the picture was not well received when first released, it is a worthwhile film with both entertaining and historical value."

Perfect example, in Peart's solo, the high-hat and ride are completely muted. Overall, a very muffled sounding DVD. Believe me, I've tried this DVD through several different entertainment systems with the same results. So don't expect an enhanced sound. Quite the opposite.

First of all, yes, it extends, but you have to sort of pull it out to the longest extent yourself, you can't really just flick it out and be done.2. (Unlike the non-light up lightsabers) When you push the blade back into the base, it doesn't click into it, it very, very easily slides out.3. It lights up, but the light is really dim.I already own a lightsaber that isn't StarWars brand, and the light is much brighter, (although it doesn't extend) but it could be fun anyway!

This entertaining expansion of a classic nursery rhyme follows the adventures of three blind mice named Unhappy, Wretched, and Content, and teaches children a lesson in character. The layout is pleasing, featuring large illustrations (with an Ancient Roman twist) to match every page of simple, large print text. A helpful English translation and glossary of Latin terms are included at the end of the book. Whether the reader is a Latin scholar or has no background in the language, this book would be a wonderful addition to home and school (especially classical school) libraries."

Too long, too convoluted with rather crude characters and no where near enough romance or even sex for that matter. The sex that happens is some of the most mediocre I've ever read.

His association with Paul Dempster, an accomplished magician whose career Dunstan launched, introduces and pursues an element of mystery and deeper meanings in life. Fifth Business is highly readable and presents a broad panorama of life over the span of one's life, in the tradition of European novels such as those written by Thomas Mann or Hermann Hesse. In its broad scope the novel treats its characters as stylized creations that - by design - lack the intensity and vulnerability that one expects from a true-to-life piece of fiction."
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","ISAN - Clockwork Menagerie CLOCKWORK MENAGERIE, a collection of older and rare Isan tracks, emerge from the Boards of Canada school of IDM, but with a pedigree all its own. With simple melodies and rhythms, they craft outwardly benign songs with heavy emotional undercurrents thrumming beneath. ""Betty's Lament,"" for instance, is quietly beautiful, with a child's sense of wonder about the universe. But lest you think it's all melancholy and nostalgia, ""Damil 85"" comes along with a freeform wobbliness. Not all the tracks are as well-developed, however, but with short running times, they delight the ears just long enough to avoid getting too repetitive. The chiding vocal sample and childish tones of ""Rron"" is like Emily Post's music box. At turns subtle and beguiling, you can wind this clockwork up again and again."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","800CPXL -- so far it lives up to the reviews We've had the 800CPXL citrus juicer for about 1wk. So far we've juiced between 50-100 oranges, tangelo & tangerines. So far, it lives up to the reviews. The unit seems solid. It is easy to use, easy to clean, quiet, well balanced (doesn't tip or walk) and has eye-appeal (as far as appliances go). In the short time we've had it, we've juiced fruit that range from 2inches to 4 or 5in diameter. Regardless of size, they all get reamed completely. The machine is surprisingly quiet (not silent -- but quiet). I've juiced while carrying on a normal conversation. We have children as young as 7yr. They've all used the juicer (not the knife) and keep asking when they can juice some more. We have 7 small citrus trees, so this baby is going to get used. The only reason I didn't give it 5stars is the cost. The proof of whether it is worth the $$ won't come for years (we expect this juicer to last a long time)."

My husband and I were equally irritated by this and could not even finish watching it.This film is like those movie montage ""previews"" that show you a snippet of dozens of films without pausing long enough for you to take in what any one of them is.

He is a leading proponant of the idea that the planet Earth will be subject to massive changes in the near term future. The book covers his ideas on how the cosmos operates, how he gets his visions and a description of the predicted earth changes. People who follow New Age ideas will find much familiar material but some new. For me, it took quite a suspence of belief to follow Scallion's ideas. The true believer may enjoy it more."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","I really wanted to like this book I love the premise of this book. I don't mind the stretches of imagination the story requires. The problem that I have is in the writing and editing. There are several problems that leap out at you right away. The dialog needs work. While there is the start of some good witty repartee, it seems that is the only way characters in this book interact. The author needs to dial that back a bit and provide some basis for the characters to engage like that. Whie I like the characters, they need to be introduced slower, and you need to be given some understanding of them before you can care about them. Some of the primary characters act quite childish and incredibly emotional. There are few well balanced personalities evident, and that makes it are to relate.I think this is a good raw start of a book in need of a strong professional editor."

Former Family Feud game show host Richard Dawson is great as the slimy evil game show host, and the rest of the cast includes Maria Conchita Alonso (as a love interest who believes Arnie's innocence), the late Yapphet Kotto (as one of Arnie's pals), and Governor Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura.

The smashing missions are cool but the stealth missions suck... bad. the voice acting is decent but the music really gets annoying. The controls are easy to just pick up and play.

That said, we didn't come away from the book with much in the way of concrete suggestions.We might add a caveat for the traditional Catholic reader: the author presents a view decidedly against Church teaching when he ventures into sexual topics.

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Fly No Further If you are looking for the definitive theatrical version of ""Lord of the Flies"", here it is. All essential thematic elements are included without laboring over miscellaneous detail. Sure, it could be longer to include every detail from the novel, but it loses nothing at its current length. I found it very useful as a follow up to classroom study, and my students adjusted well to the black and white presentation. You know it hits the mark when you need to pass out Kleenex, after Simon and Piggy's deaths, to a jaded bunch of ninth graders. Worth the investment!!"

I guess I'm just jaded-I'd like some semblance of a storyline with my erotica-and it's just not here folks. The three stories bedroom scenes also fall heavily onto submission and domination-also not my personal cup o' tea.I find the best thing to share about this anthology really is the book is exactly what the title suggests-strangers who have just met and go at it-but of course they fall in love after the grunting subsides-Geesh!Take my advice-skip this and go straight for the pay per viewNo stars."

What I really want is one of the variable temp ones that is also suitable for green teas as well as the higher temps for black teas.
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Not all 140 lb paper! I ordered 2 packs of this ""Arches 140 lb cold Press Watercolor Paper"". Even though the water mark on the paper said it was Arches, several of the sheets in each pack were not nearly as thick as 140 lb Arches Cold Press usually is. It looked as if they may have been Arches rejects. The package was not the usual Arches plastic packaging that I have received many times when I have bought Arches from other sources. I ordered this for an upcoming watercolor workshop, to share with another artist. I thought the paper thickness (weight) may have been just my imagination, but the other artist called to my attention that the paper seemed too thin to be 140 lb as well. The cost was less than what I usually pay for Arches, but I guess you get what you pay for!! I won't be ordering from this source again."
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Agree with previous review=Should have stayed ""Unreleased""(!) I *love* Darin, but not this horrible CD. Capital was right not to release this material originally, and now they're cashing in by peddling crud.The songs are boring and monotonous, the arrangements are unimaginative yet they still manage to be too elaborate with background vocals way too intrusive and therefore overshadowing Darin's voice. And The Man's vocals are totally uninspired and flat - with (uncharacteristically) little personality or spark. He's really not stylizing or personalizing these songs. His voice doesn't even sound that great on the few tunes where the other vocalists don't drown him out.I think even the most definitive Darin music collection can do without this one. If this was the only Darin CD I ever heard I would have no idea why he is considered such a great singer and star by so many, myself included."
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Good Narrative of Historical Takes Tompkins starts with an introduction to the genocide of peoples and desecration of the ancient Mesoamerican cultural structures by the Spaniards before getting to a very readable romp about personalities who attempted to preserve or ripoff Teotihuacan and other archeaological sites. The book presents a good overview of this site, which unlike the Giza/Egyptian pyramid complexes was not treated to in depth technical study until the 1950s and later. Even now, large portions remain unexcavated. The later parts of the book delve into Atlantean connections, a natural link with the speculations of Augustus Le Plongeon and others who appear earlier in the text. While it is not directly a history of the Maya, Olmecs, Aztecs, or others, there is enough citation within the interesting sidenotes and extensive bibliography to take serious readers into the bowels of the beast as of the 1970s, when this was published. All in all, this is a very nice little treasure."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Great for beginner I just recently started sewing again, and thought this would be a nice little item to have, it has all the things you would need for sewing. There are plenty of threads, in lots of different colors. It does have several storage areas, and all the basics. Some of the items are small, but for the beginner they are very good. I ended up taking out what I would use, and putting the box up on the cupboard. It would be very handy if you were going to attend a class for sewing, you could have everything in one spot. There is even a pocket to hold the patterns. So after looking at it, for me, its not exactly what I was looking for, but for some one just starting out, it would be perfect. It would be a great gift for the beginner seamstress."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","""Grab me the bottle of Vivarin. Hurry...before I...zzzzz..."" Moonspell's stylistic changes have been a bit too drastic for me from album to album. I loved their first mCD, Wolfheart, and like Irreligious. They seemed to lose their raw edge too quickly, and some of their passion dissipated with it. The previous albums were enjoyable, but I can't say the same for this.On this new album, they've mellowed out so much that I'm not sure they're even alive any more. The vocals are painfully monotone and flat. It looks like they're trying for a subtle gothic dance-club theme while using the metal guitars to maintain their status in that genre as well. It doesn't work. I don't know if goth finds will like this, but I doubt many metal fans will. The use of strange percussion emphasizes their new direction, but it sounds like a bunch of pots and pans banging around in the back of a truck. I don't know why they did it, but it's all through the album, and wears thin as the counter reaches the 60th minute."

OK, this is an Authentic "" Region O "" import, but most (not all) DVD's made available this way, that I have seen, are from top quality, crystal clear, source material, but this is a disappointing, dark, grainy version on the DVD, similar to the lowest VHS picture quality, you could possibly imagine, maybe 1 out of 10 & the sound is not much better at 3/10.Overall, a very disappointing DVD, of so poor quality that it won't be added to my collection. The day's when buyers & collector's, like myself, would accept inferior quality material, just to own your very own copy, are long gone & I won't lower my standards, as rubbish is still rubbish, no matter what format it is presented in.BE WARNED, don't waste your money!( The 2 star rating is for the DVD quality only! )"

I knew that I had wasted my money when reading the Introduction the author states that she assumes that you already have a background in Spanish, and have learned all of the verb tenses, then she goes on to recommend Spanish for Dummies if you are a rank beginner.

Most of the book is annoying because of its italicized reflections and questions about the Self that are reminiscent of a diary of a teenage girl, but definitely not one of Cho's caliber.And that's too bad.

The problem with these headphones is they don't stay in your ear. There is a branch at the top of the headphone where the left unit and the right unit split from the main cord that goes to you're mp3 player. This separation at the top means that the slightest pull on the actual cord will pop your headphone out in one ear constantly. I have to pull the cord over my ear then put it in to keep them in. And if you are working out with these headphones, try another set. The in ear design works perfectly unless you are sweating, then they fall right out. In conclusion, they are a terrible purchase, and the sound quality is equal to much simpler less expensive headphones not carrying the ""sony"" name."

Also, something about a contract where they wouldn't be able to release it until 2005?

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Very disappointing. This album could have been a good one if it weren't for two things. Number one, the sound quality of A Storm In Heaven is just plain horrible. Ashcroft's vocals are just about nonexistant, as McCabe's guitars steal all of the glory throughout nearly the entire recording. Even some of the guitar work in this album is atrocious. As one reviewer said, parts of this album sound like a 'bad bootleg'. Another reason why ASIH gets two stars is because of the poor songwriting by Ashcroft. Before I bought this album I was expecting to hear thought-provoking, heartfelt lyrics and some decent guitar work. Well, the guitars deliver somewhat, but there were no lyrics that brought out any emotions whatsoever. ""I must be feeling alone...I talked to God in a phonebox on my way home. I told you my answer...I left you my dreams on your answering machine."" These are the kind of lyrics that you'll find on Urban Hymns(check out A Northern Soul too). Giving this album two stars is very generous."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A good collection For anyone who can remember what REALLY started the video game market, this is a collection of those pioneering games that were so fun and addictive. Activision has provided 30 games originally for the Atari VCS (2600) and has kept them fairly well preserved.There were a few noticeable problems however. Games like Kaboom! which use the analog paddle control are impossible. The lightning-fast paddle controller is ill-represented by the PS D-pad. Also, the sounds seem to be from the lower-pitched PAL chips, rather than the higher NTSC. Similarly, some of the graphics seem to vary a bit from the originals. Of course, being that I still own a VCS, I can point out these differences.Overall, this isn't a bad buy. For anyone who doesn't have an Atari VCS around but still would love to play their old favorites, this is going to be just right for you. For those in the other category, it may be better to stick with your VCS; nothing feels quite the same as the originals."

Mussolini's transition from socialism to fascism is awfully abrupt, as if he woke up one morning and decided, for no particular reason, to start the Fascist Party. One would like to have heard more about Fascism's roots in socialism and syndicalism. Nevertheless, this is the best video life of Mussolini currently available."

But on p. 55, he describes the ill-fated golf trip to Staten Island (which happened several weeks or months before Bill got sober) as also taking place on Nov. 11, 1934: clearly not just a typo, since the point of this story is that it took place on Armistice Day.

I like suspense and drama too. This movie tried to combine them all - and actually did a fairly decent job. It could of been a solid 3 star beauty in the rough. HOWEVER, I'm getting a little miffed at movies that have an anti-hero ending simply to make it more artsy or make the director feel like there's some kind of deep meaning. Some life changing moment in film.That's fine and dandy if your owning a 5 star file (for instance Cold Mountain - kills the hero and still ends up being a fine movie). Or your solid Trauma type movies like ""Hobo with a shotgun"" - ending MAKES that movie a solid 3 star gore fest.If your a decent little 3 star movie and your going for that 4th star by killing your hero, just don't do it. It pisses me off. Anyway that's my rant. Thanks for reading."

Within the first year, blew a bulb and required a new optical engine. (The optical engine is the heart if the TV-set and will cost about $2k+). After that it was a new bulb every 9 mo.+, at $300 a lamp. Thank God for the extended service contract!Finally, in 2007 the ballast went out. After two mo.+ no ballast repair/replacement available. Ultimately, and after some haggling, the extended service contract basically refunded the initial purchase price for the TV.I have moved on since. Lesson learned: never another Panasonic TV in my living room...P.S.: Without an extended warranty on a, at that time, $4k purchase, I'd be severly ""unhappy"". Thank God, the extended warranty came thru all the way!"

I have researched other blenders, however, and it seems to be a universal problem of immersion blenders. And so I am purchasing another from KitchenAid, despite the problems. Now I suppose I'll have two motors."

This book gave me a real idea and meaning about how friendship works, especially when her friends were deciding if they should be her friend. ""The Wish"" showed some real meaning about friendship, and why they should be some one's friend or not. I do recommend this book to any one thatlikes a lot of things going on. This book is exciting, sad,romantic, and many other feelings. This book I recommend this book to many girls who like this author. My favorite character in this book was Ardis. She was caring and popular only for a good reason. She was popular because she is nice to every one. She is VERY tall! I enjoyed reading about her and every one else. Even though Ardis wasn't the main character, she was my favorite. I think that if you read this, you will like her to!"

It got so boring. Every time it came on, I just switched the station (although there was no station that wasn't playing this song, so I turned my radio off altogether.) I mean, after a few months you'd think this would be all played out and they'd quit playing it, but not this. If that many people like Butterfly, just buy it. I just wish they'd get over Butterfly and start playing what IS ""Today's Hit Music"" because this is turning into yesterday's, and the people who don't like this song (i.e., me) are getting sick of the radio."

Just not as wild, or as evil as they used to be, and the new songs just don't have the same drive to em' that makes you want to get up off your chair and jump up and down.

Overall the results were very good and I recommend this product.
5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Would you like MLA or APA with that? ""Writing Research Papers: A complete Guide"" is essential to those who write these papers often. The first 130 pages serve as a basic review of Information and rot Data collection mixed with organizational schemes, parallelism and whatnot. The last 250 pages discuss in detail Modern language Association (MLA) format and American Psychological Association (APA) format research papers. I personally recommend that you buy the tabbed book, while it is more expensive; it provides easy access to the very difficult APA Reference page material and data. In all honesty, the only real importance to this book is the APA materials, as MLA is intrinsically easy, and most people who pick up this book have already dealt with the basic material, which is at the front of the book. This book offers some use to the more experienced research paper writers, and exponentially more to those with less experience."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Interesting info, but her personal rants are out of line! Somers does a nice job of compiling valuable information, and she clearly states her lack of medical expertise. What bothered me was her strange preaching of a conservative agenda, which was completely out of place. She consistently bashes feminism & feminists by name, blaming this ""modern movement"" for the state of women's health. She repeats over & over how we need to have lots of babies, breastfeed, skip birth control [no thanks, Suzanne, that was the life of my short-lived elders]. She praises the health habits of Bush, while damning Bill Clinton; she even manages to mention Monica! What is going on here? Is she planning on running for office? The vegetarian rant was also weird. Lastly, I had a hard time reconciling her preventive prehysterectomy with her claims of safety.Overall, I had a hard time taking her seriously."

Judi Dench is absolutely marvelous as the weaker of the two sisters (can you believe it of strong Judi Dench?) and on the whole, the cast is brilliant--and followers of BBC costume dramas will recognize more than one or two familiar faces. That might be a turnoff for some but welcome for others. I received this DVD as a Valentine gift from my husband and will watch it again and again."

They have already done this THREE times on the DVD release, so I don't see why New Line should be any different. Just because Miramax folded, New Line has usually been pretty good with their stuff.

DO NOT BUY this product and wait for other release at the unspecified ""later date."" Let's all put an end to this despicable practice by saying enough! You already got our bucks for the DVDs, can't you ease up a little on the Blu Rays? I guess everybody wants to be like George Lucas and go back to the well and fleece their fans some more."

For example, when some drifter hippies rape a girl and then give her grandfather acid, a young boy gets revenge on the hippies by feeding them meat pies laced with rabies. This kid is proactive! The movie is still gruesome today, although it seems clear that it would now fit into the R-rated category without much controversy.

Well this one had only mediocre writing and his worst ending ever! I really was disappointed. His writing still outshines most, but pales in comparison to that of his previous books. And the ending? I don't mind if it's a bit depressing, but this one was downright obscene. In the last chapter he stops writing and starts preaching, and the sermon is bad for any Americans--we're arrogant imperialists who faked the war in Iraq for oil and power, and worse than that, we're at fault for our response to terrorism. Seeing as how that was written by a man whose country didn't lose thousands of citizens on 9/11, I'm afraid I take offense. My recommendation: Wait for us his next book, probably he'll do better."

It's everything the reviewer (Richard Bernstein) promised, and more. It's the sort of book best read in one or two sittings--you completely get into this world, and the writing just takes you over. Yes some of it's brutal and sad, but I sensed some light, a strong ray of hope, from the very beginning that is born out as the book proceeds. The author always manages to keep it there, and it makes you care, makes you care passionately what happens to the narrator and his sister's baby in the next room. It's a universal story, it's Calcutta but it's anywhere. I could go on and on--I can't tell you what a classy, important writer this guy is. This book is major!"

Only the Triple Crown was presented and not the remainder of his racing career. All in all, however, it was an ""all right"" movie."

They get tossed around and banged up to one another and have not had a single problem with them cracking or anything. I wish the magnets were a tad bit stronger, but it works. I also wish there were more pieces, its difficult to build a whole ton of things with these. But overall, we love these tiles!

The characters could have been developed a bit more. Actually there was so many characters that I wanted to learn more about but she didn't give enough of a description. Lots of fluffy words --- she definately gets an A+ for her use of adjectives. Lots of gaps!!!!

That's nice, but I would have liked to have some end-of-chapter exercises so that I could have applied what was covered in the chapter. There were also some omissions in the code starting in Chapter 8, which kept the class from being able to compile correctly.While this book may appeal to those that can pick up the nuances of a programming language by just reading code, those of us who learn by doing would be better off looking elsewhere."

I'm sorry to burst another reviewer's bubble, but as a Conservative/Libertarian I enjoyed this movie immensely.The Democratic Party of today bares little to no resemblence to the party of the time of JFK.I enjoyed this movie, and liked the idea that had JFK lived we would have colonized the Moon and beyond.Also, how could avoiding Viet-Nam be a bad thing?And Martin Luther King as Vice President of the U.S.A. is a bold move and welcome outcome of preventing the assasination of the President.For those who are fans of Time Travel, and What-ifs. I highly recommend this movie. It's fun, it's not complicated, it tells a compelling story."

This CD is not original, not groundbreaking, not talented, not awe-inspiring, nothing more than easy to write, prefebricated, mass produced, pop music with a buffed up shine and an attractive singer. Backstreet Boys with guitars. If thats what you want, you could even do better than Matchbox 20, trust me, just keep looking."

He never fails to give me a giggle in this cynical, depressed fin-de-20th-siecle era. Think Weird Al Yankovich, circa 1945."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","This really ain`t all that great in my opinion. Okay, first of all, Tell Me It`s Real is VERY annoying. When K-Ci and Jojo sing the chorus it makes me wanna cover my ears! They just belt it out like they`re Celine Dion or something. This song is a real disappointer to me, `cuz those two did such a beautiful job with All My Life. Where the hell did they go wrong? And for some reason, their voices sound different and not as good as when they sang All My Life. I can`t believe how every dang person in the U.S. can listen to this song and consider it one of the best they`ve heard. Maybe your eardrums are different from mine, I don`t know. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the story K-Ci and Jojo are trying to tell people about true love and deep emotions, like they did in All My Life. But unfortunately, that was blocked by bad melodies and a chorus that sounds like a mare in labor is singing it."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",Too contrived and plot lines thin Ship of fools is very readable but I found it rather lacking in the plotting. The author wanted to set up a sense of dread and fear but did so at the cost of any depth. Characters tend to be paper thin and there is not enough background to explain any of their actions. Too much historical background is left unknown never allowing the reader to connect with the story.

Cuts are easy and smooth. I use it on a router table, and it is works well. The major reasons I didn't give it a five are: One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well. I replaced it with a Router Raizer and it works much better. Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well. The sliding latch is does not stay in place. It is almost all you can do to change bits with two hands (you need three). I am trying to purchase a second wrench, and I think it will improve the function greatly. Other than this, I am very pleased with the router and would buy it again. I really liked the price..."

Getting three had such possibilities for lots of content.The car chase disc was perhaps one third of interviews and theory from poice officers about the kind of training they get, what I really wanted was car chases. The quality of the picture at times is poor, but as the footage is from mounted cameras in patrol cars this is fair enough.The fast cars disc featured only three cars, not really an overall view of ""fast cars"" but is still worth looking at.A three DVD box set could have been really cool, instead it seems rather diluted."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Modern? This previously out of print set has Red with Charlie Parker for over half the first disc and the sound is not too good. Then you get to what you paid for, Red, Tal and Mingus. The tunes this combo recorded, live and in the studio, if left to one good take, could have been fit on one 80 minute disc. Instead what you get here is multiple takes of almost every song with the first take of each, strangely being the worst. Really for historical significance only. If you are a Tal Farlow fan, save your money and get the Mosaic box set. This was an incredible combo for a short period of time. It's a shame their legacy sounds like this."

Songs like Breathe, and Grace Flows Down bring absolute peace and contentment on my most turbulent and upsetting days. The songs The Noise We Make and America get you pumped up for God and inspired. The song We Fall Down, that's sang in Setswana, is absolutely magical and powerful. Salvation is always a song I come back to when I need to feel God's presence.

For me, the most grave is on page 64, where the author states that HCN (Zyklon B ) was used in Treblinka. Carbon Monoxide gas was used in the Aktion Reinhard camps. This error could create confusion going forward, especially with younger or less experienced scholars. And just this one factual error makes me seriously question the research in the rest of the book -- in spite of the fact that I am almost positive that the information about typhus experimentation is solid.I wish I were able to recommend this book; but in the present edition, I just can't."

You will find a selection of 15 case studies with proposed solutions. Although I do not agree entirly with all the solutions, I thought the book generally provided realistic examples, with well structured and logical solutions.One further point, although you can work through the book yourself, I would recommend that you team up with a ""buddy"" and alternate the role of interviewer /ee. This will stop you from jumping to the answers to soon and enable some feedback about presentation style. The book facilitates this type of role play.Goodluck !"

Janowsky does a real good job of explaining all the subjects in just 200 pages.The book is writen around his survival and medical kits, which contents he list for you. The book is geared toward northern climates. I thought he could have gone into a little more detail on a few thing, but all in all a very good book.

I think it is easier when you read it at once (dont stop) and maybe being native english is a very big plus too. I liked it though. It appeared to me as being a little cheap, but that guy is a great fantasy-man. I dont think it is worth reading if you only read serious literature.

The more you listen to it the more you like it, which says a lot for the future.Andre 3000 Disc is one of the most creative Hip Hop albums ever created. The fact that he spends majority of the time singing does not take anything away from him still being one of the most prolific M.C's in the game. This is evident from the closing song on his disc.Big Boi's Disc is hands down the best Southern Area Hip Hop album of the year. he shows you how to have skills, fun and originality with the same ol' girls and crunk formula.Together they cannot be stopped as Hip Hop's Best Duo."

It has a 3 prong plug on the back for the iron to plug into. This means I can use my Weller Irons as well. I like Weller because you can get tips for them most anywhere.

The replayablilty value is very high, especially in cruise. This game is also incredibly detailed, which I like. There are a few minor problems with this game: First, the AI is not that good. Computer-controlled traffic cars do not stop in cruise mode unless you are exactly line up in the traffic lane. Most of the time, they act as if you weren't even there. This gets annoying sometimes. Second, bugs occasionally pop up in the form of graphic glitches and lockups. These are rare, but take away from some of the believebilaty of this game. Other than these minor problems, I think that this game is a good buy for anyone who enjoys to drive the way they can't in real life."

""Can't Get Over"", featuring Kelly Price, is far-and-away my favorite cut, and ""All Tied Up in You"" is begging for radio release.Lee makes a nice, non-white addition to the genre dominated by blond neophytes like Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera, and Britney Spears. I'd say her sound successfully blends aspects of each of those. If marketed properly, there are any number of tracks on here that could be Lee's state-side ""breakthrough."""

Our front post light is swarming with bugs nightly while our brighter hanging gazebo light in back seems to attract very few, if any bugs. Without another explanation, I'd have to give credit to the fogger for that.The propane tank and fog juice seems to be very generous in the amount of use you get out of them as well.Last summer we couldn't even play yard games without quitting at mercy of the mosquitoes.

The only negative is that it is thick and not made of those new high tech wicking fabrics so if you sweat a lot, it will get damp and stay damp for awhile.

This cd contains 9 songs from the 'Twist And Shout' sessions, unspectacularly remastered in mono BUT... the 10th and final song on here 'I Need Your Love', is from an obscure and long lost single by the Impressions (without Jerry Butler and Curtis Mayfield). The featured lead singer is Richard or Arthur Brooks with the rest of the Impressions singing background. This recording is a real rarity. I once owned this record as a 45 rpm record which came out in the late 50's. How this song got mislabeled and credited to the Isley Brothers is a real mystery. Although poorly remastered, all of the music itself is good."

Information about Cold War submarine incidents was ""compartmentalized"" -- only those immediately involved in a particular situation were allowed to know what happened. As a result, it's unlikely many former submariners are in a position to verify more than about 10% of the book from their own experience. Most of us weren't told what went on with the other boats. That's true in my case.Having said all that, what I did already know of in this book from my own Navy tour is accurately depicted in this book and the other stuff seems very credible."

There is no real belief that one person could follow someone through life and never be spotted and never really lose his quarry.

The arm holes are very small in diameter and if you have any sort of muscle tone it will be too tight. The bodice is not true to size, more like 1 1/2 to 2 sizes smaller than the listed garment size. This will not fit tall women unless you are rail thin and have a small bustline. Length is great, material and design is great too. It would be a great costume too bad the sizing is inaccurate."

Underground hip-hop heads are clearly dissapointed at the rap veteran, for his album was ""ok"" and a couple tracks away from a mediocre performance. The production for this album was extremely good, but its lyrical delivery is far from genius.

The transitional focus change from what might be seen as a bit more action to a reflective deeper character frankly flopped. I don't care not because the character isn't worth it but because the author doesn't carry it off.After reading the following books I wondered if this wasn't the first attempt to save something the author had grown bored with and serial characters can become boring. Other authors have started this transition leading to Best Sellers with only a few grunts of ""no"" from a few die hard fans of the other version of the writing. Branching off into other works is also a trait. The following books were way below standard for her.

It can store almost unlimited amount of pics, unlike the 83,83+, which can only store 10. The calculator also does conversions. Everything from temp to energy to power, making it save all that time on tests and homework. I read another review that said it could not do absolute value(which is called abs), and convert fractions to decimals(>frac, and >dec), but it can. They aren't under a bunch of subfolders either, because you can easily create your own custom menu to paste anything you want on the screen. This way is even faster.

If you are going to disassemble the carrier for traveling purposes, take a hammer with you.

This book has ""oversized diagrams"" to fill in the space for lack of material. This book uses games to go along with the tactical problems set up (good concept if done correctly). The problem here is that as stated by the other reviewers there is very little analysis of where a player went wrong to reach these bad positions - why bother with the games in this case?

Haldeman's earlier works, such as Mindbridge and Forever War are great stories told by a great storyteller. His latest works have been less than great stories and definitely not written like the storyteller he once showed us to be. This book, Forever Peace, reads like a movie, and I very much expect it will be picked up. It has all the pointless violence and gory detail that a movie needs, with lots of room for cool special effects. I am sure that Haldeman intended the violence to make a point, and be realistic, but unlike other good ""war"" stories, the violence in this book did not enhance the plot; it hindered it."

I was amazed that he served in World War II and how success he was in his advertising career before Formula 1.I found much of the story after this a little repetitive and hap-hazard in way that it was presented. I also felt it was also drawn out in many ways which was disappointing. The information about the growth in popularity and the behind the scenes of Formula 1 was certainly of interest to me being fan but as I said a little drawn out.If you are a fan of Murray and are interested in how he came to be the voice of Formula 1 then I'd recommend you have a read. If you are looking for an insiders look at one of the biggest sports in the world I'd suggest another book maybe more appealing.

There is a bug in the configuration that prevents you from automatically seeing the Mac addresses of attached wireless devices. This makes it difficult to add them to your Mac filter if you use one. You have to manually type in the addresses. A Pain.2. After 3 months of using this product, and suffering random repeated loss of Internet requiring reboots, we finally traced it to this router. The drops, both wired and wireless, only happen with this router in the picture. Didn't happen with my old WGR614. This is apparently a widespread problem that Netgear has yet to admit to or resolve.

The text consists of notes made from the point of view of a disgusted servant. This is vulgar humor (Twain wrote in his autobiography, ""...if there is a decent word findable in it, it is because I overlooked it"") and it will not appeal to all tastes, but Mark Twain buffs may appreciate seeing an unusual side of Twain, and it's said that Twain would pick up the text and laugh at it with close friends.

Many of her ideas are so integrated into modern thought (ie self-realization, tyranny of the should, alienation from self) that it is difficult to fully appreciate her originality today. As a piece of intellectual history, it makes interesting reading. But in terms of clinical relevance, its usefulness is quite limited. I, too, chose to read this because Yalom wrote in ""Gift of Therapy"" that he found it one the most helpful therapy books during his training. How times have changed!

If, on the other hand, you are waiting for a DVD treatment worthy of this beautiful movie, you have more waiting ahead of you."

Having first watched the original extended versions of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl who Played with Fire and The Girl who Kicked the Hornets' Nest, I was rather disappointed with the new Daniel Craig version. The Swedish version starring Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist is absolutely brilliant and gripping throughout. Watch the Millennium Trilogy with a friend over a weekend. You will thoroughly enjoy the experience."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","design good but could be improved I purchased this reader since it accepts a micro sd card and conceals it. I use a card reader as my standard PC flash drive so when I travel I pop out the sd card and use it in my motorola xoom. Most readers leave the posterior segment of the sd card hanging out that leaves it vulnerable if using as an everyday flash drive. This reader tucks it away well. My main complaint is that the head cap is designed to work with the base cover. Ideally I just want to cover the plug on the reader itself. In summary, if you only use micro sd cards and you want it concealed then the vivitar micro sd reader is best. If you want the reader to accept more card types then the blueproton is best."

The connection was great before the router was in place. After I correclty got this thing configured, I noticed connection reliability was below my acceptable levels. Dropped connections non stop through out the day.For the past day I have circumvented the router by going direct to the modem. Not a glitch, perfect connection.

It's fun for the first ten minutes or so, but after that...ho-hum.3) I would not pay to go see this in person; I fell asleep the first time I watched it.Now the positive things:1) Only a couple songs were clever and memorable.

The book is intelligent without being overabsorbed, and is full of fantastic information. A great read and an invaluable reference book alike. Pick this one up!"

The Boys, to be fair, do the up-beat, up-tempo tracks pretty well, perhaps better than most of the other boy-bands out there, and Larger Than Life probably is the best of the bunch. On the other hand, they are not so adept at tackling the slower, slushy numbers. These tended to be plaintive at best, but at worst pathetic. The lyrics are just awful!

Amberdrake, Skan and the others are all older, so the focus changes to their children, who, badly wounded, get lost on a mission and their fathers lead a rescue party.Things I liked: the pacing for the first two thirds of the book; I did enjoy the characterizations of Amberdrake, Skan et al, how being parents of the missing changed their viewpoints.Things I didn't like? Normally, Lackey writes teen emotions really well. In fact, some of her strongest work deals with outsiders trying to fit in and the rejection they receive. Here, this is all glossed over. It's mentioned, then put away. The last part of the book felt very, very rushed.Overall, this book is for people who live the Valdemar books or who have read the other books in this trilogy. Otherwise, no so much."

It is now in the possession of my 9-yr old son who enjoys thumbing through the pages and looking at the pictures (probably the best part of this book).

If I ever figure out what I'm doing with it I will change to a kinder review but I don't have a lot of hope for that. Reading the (deplorable) directions I see that one can only make playlists using the buttons on the device and do it individually for every song through a process- there seems to be no ability to do so on the computer.

As a proffesional bodyguard, I need to keep people under control, and nothing beats a taser for the job. Unfourtunately, it's really uncomfortable to walk around with a taser in your hands. Sometimes, I just REALLY need the use of my left hand, no ifs, ands or buts about it. That's where this holster comes in. Put your taser in, take it out, it's quicker than a Disney world rollercoaster ride and smoother than a freshly opened bottle of Jack. Only problem is the price. At that level, only your real proffesionals will buy this. Take it down a notch and you got my five stars."

If you are considering this magazine by the title alone, you probably know what you like and that lies somewhere between town and country. I happen to like reading articles on many different topics including decorating, gardening, and fashion - this magazine usually has something to offer in many different areas of my interests. Yes, there are TONS of ads for things way beyond my means but the ads keep the subscription costs low and are even sometimes places to find inspiration for creative projects. If you happen to catch the November special pricing of five dollars for a whole year you can't go wrong, even if you just thumb through to look at the pictures. Nothing to lose since publishers will refund the balance of unwanted subscriptions if you are not happy."

However, the readouts are always consistent, so the discrepancies, if any, should be no problem.We like our unit; it's small and inconspicuous.

I've never had a USB problem before with any other product.They finally sent me a replacement (an upgraded unit, the MP180), but it exhibited the same problem.

I re-read Johnny every few years and still enjoy every word and still find something important in it.A word to students, if you are reading it for class and resent having to read it then you won't enjoy it, but if you think of it as an adventure story and if you want to find out how our country began this is a very good book to find out. Would you enjoy reading about a young boy on another planet fighting to save his world from being dominated by a race from another galaxy? It could almost be the same story.I think there are some books that are meant to be read throughout your life, ""The Secret Garden"" and ""A Tale of Two Cities"" are two and so is ""Johnny Tremain""."

One of his daughters might be a lesbian and the other is just mean. He doesn't know what to do. That's when golf pro Helen Hunt moves to town and he is immediately infatuated with her.

Having seen the widescreen version on Japanese import, the full-screen picture ruins a lot of the nice shots in this.Come on guys, get with the program and stop with the full-screen already! Also, an option to have the Japanese voices would also be amazingly appreciated."

Second there is no arbor lock on the machine to help screwing the spindle on and off. Last of all, the motor seems weak to me. A stronger motor would be much better. It is poorly designed and not up to the quality I expect in a tool made by Delta."

Done by his family, I get the sneaky suspicion it was staged to appear live.Everything is close up, you don't see an audience, unless a clip of an audience was slipped in toward the end. The music is ok, but lacks that live feeling. It is simply song after song, after song; no feeling of connecting with his audience, and certainly no feeling of performing live.Apparently it may have been done with a videocamera, and it sure looks it. I'm sure the family wants to put out some concert performance of Conway, either for memories or money, but this is done poorly, too distracting to attempt to enjoy Conway. .....Rizzo"

It's not just one or two answers, it is the majority of them. Our instructor provided us with the even numbered answers (likely provided in the instructor resources) and those answers are incorrect as well. See Chapters 5 & 6 if you want to check for yourself. For a book that costs over $136 on Amazon, and $177 from the publisher (Pearson), it could at least be accurate so students can verify their answers.Pearson and the author need to publish errata on the Pearson website and provide the correct solutions to the end-of chapter problems."

The patterns involving the skills you've learnt from reading the book are simple and mostly for children.

His style is absolutely spell binding! Personally I don't like modern/contemporary art (the last chapter in this book), but I kept on reading about it, simply because it was written so well. Of course the book is carefully researched, there is all the information you could wish for, and yet, despite its volume, it is not a mere enumeration of isolated facts, events, historical data. Robert Hughes brings it all together like in a historical novel. Very rewarding! I do wish he would write about European art (medieval art, renaissance, baroque, romanticism etc.) the way he did about American Art."

I have always especially enjoyed JOC's more upbeat alternative rock sounding songs and found none of those on this album. All the songs are more contemplative, slower songs...nothing that really makes you want to tap your feet or sing at the top of your lungs. The lyrics are great as always. but the musical style on this one, just isn't quite up to par...If you are thinking about buying this one, and you like them becuase of their alternarock, upbeat sound, this one is probably not going to be one of your favorites."

I got it because I am used to its predecessor and the price was right. I like the selection button for frozen items. The toast cycle can be cancelled by pushing the cancel button. The toaster makes good consistently brown toast. I did not give this toaster 5 stars because it is difficult to clean. Yes there is a removable crumb tray, but a lot of crumbs get caught inside and never make to the crumb tray. The only way to clean out those crumbs is to blow it out with compressed air, which we have. The other thing that bothers me is that I have to lift the toast out of the toaster by moving the push handle up all the way. If the item is small I have to go get a fork. The picture of the items in this toaster is misleading. Most items just peek above the top and that is only if you push the handle up."

It arrives beautifully packaged and looks great on the kitchen counter. A lot of thought went into a beautiful, compact and simple design.

It's a complete step in the right direction after the frantic and somewhat uninspired ""Fat of the Land"".This album is fast-paced, crunchy, and does everything right to keep me interested and satisfied.My favorite track right now is Hotride, the female's vocals being wonderfully deviant and not beautiful at all, but fitting right in with the crunchiness of the track. Other tracks of mention include the single, ""Girls"", and ""Memphis Belles"".The problem with the disc that I had overall is that it tends to flow into itself, and if you are using it as background music it becomes monotonous. You have to listen to it, really listen, to enjoy it all the way through.Definitely give this disc a try."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","interesting, but dated This work covered the case of three women on death row. At first, I thought the work was going to be one-sided, but I think it later tries to allow viewers to come to their own conclusions. Bill Kurtis repeats that far fewer women who kill get put on death row. Then of those on death row, many of them get their sentences communted. He asks, but never answers, why are states so less likely to kill women.Here's the thing, the work never mentions Aileen Wuournos, so I think this was produced before her crimes in the early 90s or late 80s. The work covers imprisoned women who go on to say they've become evangelicals and they could preach against violence if they were allowed to live. I recall an old law professor telling me that line doesn't get women off death row nowadays.In short, great facts, but they're from 20 years ago!"

Claustrophobic static, low-budget sets were the name of the game in British TV drama and comedy of the time, with very few forays into the outside world meant that storylines had to be intriguing and tight, and acting needed to be convincing and on-the-ball. In this respect 'The Sandbaggers' does not disappoint. The stories are just as dark and cynical as you'd expect from a Cold War spy drama. 'Callan' is also a must-have from this genre. It's great to see these 'greats' being resurrected for ardent LWT fans."

Today, the unit was completely inoperative and required that I cool it down with hose water before it ""came back on line."" Worse, it had lost its time even though it didn't loose either program I'd stored. So, even if it did come to function again over night, it wouldn't know what time it really was!

And while he succeeded in presenting the UN as the punching bag and scapegoat of the superpowers, he failed, due mainly to the constraints of the 'Beginners' format, to sufficiently forward discussion of what the UN and its member organizations due well.

It is an acceptable courtroom drama of the early fifties but it has few Noir elements to make it appeal to a modern viewer. It seems rather simplistic for an Elia Kazan film. Those looking for a Kazan Noir should check out ""Panic in the Streets"" with its beautiful photography and Jack Palance's raw energy, or ""On the Waterfront"" with Brando and Steiger and Cobb showing what acting is all about.A better Dana Andrews film for Noir fans would be Otto Preminger's ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" in which Dana Andrews plays a violent cop who goes a bit too far and kills a suspect. His efforts to conceal his crime make for a film with much dark appeal. While the film is rather brightly lit for a Noir, the mood is quite dark."

I think an appreciation of the era in which these were created is in order before the presentation is criticized.This is the real deal, and animation fans, Superman fans and film aficionados alike should enjoy the ASTOUNDING work done by the Fleischers at the time. These shorts are still considered to be a benchmark for other animators (ie Bruce Timm) to stand up to."

I would never have read it otherwise. Lepore's thesis argued that the language and words of war are used to create the identity of a group of people.It is possible for an historian to analyze and interpret primary documents and form an arguement without exposing an apparent bias against a group or groups of people. Lepore failed in this aspect. As her arguement unfolded, the negative views against the Puritans were clearly present from her remarks concerning the Mathers to the stripping of the Puritan's cultural background.While this book is not necessarily about King Philip's War, it is filled with gore. So if you would like a literary treatment of bloody massacres or if revisionist history is your preference, read this book. If not, find something else."

Also...I don't think it was such a hot idea to make a film, as it only added up to a few stories told episodically. There was no single story line to sustain a film.

Dennis Hopper was too wrapped up in the 40's, making you think he was going ""Back to Future"" on us here. The explosion expected, the one where Viggo outwits Hopper, does not happen, or vice versa.

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","The complaints are real I bought a Gryffindor scarf and tie, both made by Rubies. The colors do not match between the two products -- not even close. The tie has a decently accurate color per what you see in the movies. The scarf is a very dark purple and dark/muddy orange. It doesn't look like the product photo and I'm sad to see Warner Brothers authorized this level of quality in one of its products. If I'd seen this scarf in person, I wouldn't have bought it."
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","VW Bug, the Skipper too... Bad. That's the only way to say it. This movie is ""no-budget"" film making trying to make an effects extravaganza. And failing. The movie includes the infamous VW Bug as the giant bug, the ""hi-tech"" science lab which seems to be in high school biology classroom, untold shots of basically meaningless shadows and darkness, and the Skipper from Gilligan's Island as the ""comic relief"" -- read: spouting corny jokes. The film can be enjoyed two ways: (1) Enjoy the hokiness in the way B-movie can. (2) Watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version. The MST3K version is hilarious! This version features hilarious running commentary pointing such details as ""Lab provided by Mrs. Johnson's class,"" or ""'But, You can't see anything in this shot!' Be quiet film school grad! I'm the director, you just keep rolling!'"" Also there is a running gag about the mobs screaming ""Packers!"""

It is great improvement over the non anamorphic DVD that has been out for many years.Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy, and Sarah Jessica Parker as the three witches are great. The highlight of the movie.No extras, kind of a bummer.Over all I give it 3 stars for the soft, but good transfer and no extras.

I spent the good part of the first hour with this toy just chasing balls down in the hardest to reach parts of my house (the balls must have some sort of sensor that attracts them to the furthest corner under the couch).Since the balls are never near the toy, the kid doesn't get to play with them much.

When Tori does remakes she takes the song apart and then reassembles it in Tori fashion. That is her art, as well as her original songs. I bought this record thinking it would be fun. I had never heard of any of the other artists. I know lots of people love Tori, but the people involved with this compilation just did remakes of the songs without making the songs their own. Plus, the other problem is that Tori has such a unique sound that it doesn't really lend it's self to remakes. I think that if this record would have been put in more capable hands it could have been pulled off. But, instead, we get a bunch of Tori-wanna-be's doing Tori. And not really doing Tori very well at all..."

But they are not sumi-e. They are rather aquarelle, that mimics eastern paintings.IMHO the key thing, that makes Yolanda paintings look different is her technique of brushstokes, which are very typical to the western aquarelle school. The original sumi-e brushstrokes are based on brushstokes of chinese (well, and japanese as well) calligraphy, and this is one of the characteristics that variate paintings of differnt masters.Still, the book text is a good transcription of sumi-e/brush painting concept. Just for the painting examples I'd suggest to look at the works of the ""original"" artists."

Personally, I bought this CD for Deon Estus' ""Heaven Help Me"", but was happy with the other songs, including Hipsway's ""The Honeythief"", ""10-9-8"" by Face to Face and ""No More 'I Love You's'"" by The Lover Speaks (most listeners will be familiar with Annie Lennox's version). There are songs from ABC, Hall & Oates and the Thompson Twins, as well as from more obscure acts like The Models and One 2 Many. Like the album promises, these are the hard to find songs, the ones that have been forgotten (for the most part).

I think he captured something there that won't be easily obtained again in his future works. But it's worth a shot for him to try. I'm not saying he should do a Play part2 album. What I'm saying is that to evolve from the HUGE commercial and artistic success of the album Play is something very hard to do.The album ""18"" fell short and the ""18 B-sides"" was just a little side thing that seemed to be more acceptable than the original ""18"" album.Now he comes back with Hotel and I must say that the songs for the most part on the first CD are weak. If anything, it's the second ambient CD that saves the Hotel album. The vibe that I get from the 2nd CD is remote and pretty esoteric. I think the ambient cd would be perfect for a film such as Lost In Translation.All in all, I'd say this is for Moby's hardcore fans."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",Very disappointed Bought this for my 10 year son who is a big K'nex fan. It was very difficult to assemble. The weight of the platform caused it to collapse during construction. Once we finally completed it it was difficult to play with as every other flip of the flipper caused it to collapse again and again. I was so dissapointed in this product that I actually returned it.
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","The Man Who Wrote A Dodgy Memoir I read this book a few years ago. I remember being quite disappointed with the book and look at it as a bit of a joke. Allan Williams had the opportunity to write a really fascinating memoir, but he blew it! I would've liked a bit more about the demented behaviour of Lennon before he was famous. Some of the 'conversations' Williams remembers seem the work of fiction. One thing the book did well though, was to set the scene. Certainly not a must-read."

Jennifer O'Neill is brutely honest and forth-right - it is truly unbelievable the life that this beautiful woman has endured...but, she has survived because she found The Answer! My only wish is that there had been more pictures, as is usual in an autobiography...however, because of the content there were probably privacy issues at stake."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Not up to expectations While I found Eco's writing to be quite good, the book fell short of my expectations as a mystery novel.

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","I can leave this behind. Unlike the other reviewers, I'm actually going to review this single instead of the whole album, since this is technically the page for the single. ""Vertigo"" is by far one of the most ridiculous songs I've ever heard. ""Uno,dos,tres,catorce""??? One, two, three, fourteen?? That's just stupid. And the back up vocals yelling ""ola"" are contrived and pointless. I have friends who love Top 40 radio crap, and even they think this song is terrible. And who can argue with lyrics as profound as ""yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah..."" Thanks Bono, for proving once and for all that you are full of yourself."

Second, mentioning people like Edward Cayce favorably. Third, an undercurrent of racism inherent to much literature of this type (""of course zey could not haff made zese; zey are not European!""). On top of all that, the edition I have would appear to be a fairly bad translation of a ridiculous book, making it perfect reading for those late-night toke'n'Twinkie sessions.Get this used.

I'm sure this concert will satisfy the few thousand fans who want a momento of their concert experience (although a few filed poor reviews here too). For the rest of us who do not slug it out for a view or seat in a loud theatre, this concert was supposed to fit the bill. It doesn't.

It has the added benefit of managing customer expectations for me.

Set in the year 1977, the film revolves around the efforts of his younger brother Mikal (Giovanni Ribisi) to stop the execution, even against his brothers wishes; because Gilmore sees himself gaining permanent notoriety, he even has t-shirts with GILMORE printed on them. While well acted, the film's pace is rather stodgy and interesting only occasionally. That same year a punk song by The Adverts called GARY GILMORE'S EYES was released. The song is only a couple of minutes long. This movie is over 90 minutes. Download the song and try and find it in your heart to forgive screenwriter Frank Pugliese for making such a snoozer out of potentially interesting material. The film is based on the book by Mikal Gilmore."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","good modern hard rock CD I like this CD a lot. Shinedown has a talent for writing songs that both get in your head melodically and let you get your rocks off musically. The guitar has a clean, heavy sound to it and I like the singer's voice. Some people complain that the singer goes overboard especially on songs like 45 and Simple Man. My feelings are if you have the pipes, use them, and I'd rather hear someone sing with emotion than sounding bored like some bands do. The CD isn't perfect, I think the drumming is a little pedestrian and some of the songs at the end of the CD aren't as strong as the first half, but overall it is very good. If you're looking for a band to compare their sound to, I think they sound somewhat like Hoobastank, but I feel Shinedown's songs are better."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","don't judge a book by it's cover I bought this book based on the reccomendation from the other reviewer. When I received it, I was immediately impressed by the cool cover. However, after opening it, I found that it was essentially a 2 inch 3-ring binder with about 100 pages in it. About 2/3 of these pages are blank, and are supposed to be used to write your thoughts while traveling. The rest have very brief travel hints and recipes. The information was very superficial (i.e. names and addresses of restaurants) and would likely be available as a freebie from any tourist office in the BVI. Oh yes, there are also about 5 pages of plastic sleeves for inserting your own photos.This book was not worth the $30 price. Luckily I was able to return the book to Amazon and get a refund on my money, but I'm still out the $8 in shipping costs. If I could have ranked it zero stars, I would have."

I wanted to like it. Technically, the film is well-executed. The animation is skillfully done. Artistically, however, the film is sadly lacking. The jokes aren't funny, the characters aren't engaging, the songs aren't memorable, and the story is dull. Was this a direct-to-video project that got rushed into theaters instead?"

The Tao Te Ching needs no further comment. The translation here is very nice and is quite similar to others I have read.

I gave it three stars because if you are looking for a poetic rendition that has a nice flow and clarity then you will enjoy it. But if, like myself, you have read various editions (some good, some not so much) then without the missing material it is really not worth your money. Go and find the book."

Though there is no proven effect, I got enamored by the idea of UV light keeping the toothbrush heads clean. It was a pretty thing to be seen in the bathroom especially when the bluelight is on but it's not really as sturdy as compared to a regular toothbrush holder. The holding cups are difficult to clean and since it pools fluid from wet heads, I don't see how UV light can keep the heads sanitized. And since it is stored in the bathroom, it gets moist most of the time from the steam of the hot water. It was already broken after 3 months of use. It was really a waste of $45."

The disc cleaner functioned exactly as described it would and was easy to use. Unfortunately, my dvd player still skips. But I don't know if it is due to the Daewoo brand or the disc cleaner. So in fairness, I cannot completely say it did or did not do its job as I know as well as anyone that when you own something like a lower brand electronic for 4 years, you sometimes have to be greatful that it has lasted as long as it did. Plus, before buying the disc, I had disassembled the dvd player and tried to manually clean it, myself and that also did not fix the problem so the dvd player may be beyond repair."

We had Venus cards between us, and that meant that we had most likely been lovers in a previous life! After that I was hooked!

This blurb dishonestly gives the impression that all articles are recorded on the CD. In reality, of the 117 articles, only 29 are read on the enclosed CD.It is perfectly all right to record only a portion of the articles for readers to listen to, but this fact should have been stated honestly so that customers would not be mislead before making their purchase."

If you are new to Lovecraft, these works would probably not be appreciated as much as others. They are much more enjoyable when one has a better understanding of what Lovecraft is all about. I would suggest starting with the collection ""The Dunwich Horror and Others"" also by Arkham house.

The film stays true to this idea all the way through, and basically states that thinking in the correct way (or asking God) will garner you gifts along these three dimensions. The film is very weak and based upon personal experience of one man, with no real evidence either for or against the 'revealed' process, and the purpose seems to be to generate revenue from this poorly made documentary, with no real substance provided to the consumer."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Disappointment with history I like to read historical fiction especially that covering the classical world. Therefore, I immediately picked up a copy of Emperor: The Gates of Rome. It is the story of the young Julius Caesar and Marcus, destined to be great Romans. While the story of two young Roman boys had some appeal, I was disappointed by the lack of historicity in both the details of Julius' life and background and in the depiction of Roman culture and society. As only two examples, in this book Marius is Julius' uncle through his mother Aurelia and a Roman magistrate walks through the Forum attended by a single lictor carrying the fasces with an ax and the magistrate is said to have instant power of life or death over Roman citizens. While historical facts are often modified in historical fiction for the sake of the story or for simplicity, rarely are they so fully overthrown. For a fictional story of the young Julius, Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome series is much better done."

I highly recommend this product to anybody with this recurring problem as a safe natural alternative to antibiotics. Cleartract also comes in capsule form in case you may be in a social or business situation where it is inconvenient for you to mix the powder into a liquid.Cleartract is actually D-mannose, a type of sugar, but it is safe even for diabetics because D-Mannose isn't metabolized, so it doesn't interfere with blood sugar regulation. D-Mannose creates no disruption or imbalance in normal body microflora so it won't make you more prone to a yeast infection like antibiotics often do."

As I thought, just after three months of the first release of ""The Grudge"", now we get the release of a ""Director's Cut"". So, the people who really like this film now have to spend additional funds to get a ""complete cut"" of the movie.Of course, now the movie studios are finding even trickier ways to get your money. They advertise and ""additional 10 minutes"", but don't tell you that these are not new scenes. Instead they tack on 10 to 30 seconds to every scene. While this might sum up to an additional 10-15 minutes, the differences are hardly noticeable while watching the film (for example, the ""Hellboy"" director's cut was almost exactly the same film).If you already bought this film and really like it, it might be worth renting this director's cut to see if you think it's really worth it. One thing for sure, I no longer buy any movie that I like until it's been on DVD at least 4-6 months."

It's a sort of Decameron of music!I have subsequently read the Memoirs and these are not to be missed either.

I'm a big fan of ""dark"" Star Trek -- but this story portrays Starfleet characters commiting horrible, immoral, blatantly criminal actions after meticulous planning involving the manipulation of literally thousands of sentient lives. I like a story that forces characters to question the morality of their own actions; there was none of that here.

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Ocean's Thirteen Danny Ocean (Clooney) and his gang are back, this time to get revenge against Willie Bank (Pacino). Bank has screwed over Reuben Tishkoff (Gould), and taken his land and money to build a new casino, causing Reuben to have a heart attack. The gang, led by Ocean, Rusty Ryan (Pitt), and Linus Caldwell (Damon), decide to put the new casino deep into the red and steal Bank's diamonds.""Ocean's 13"" is a vast improvement over ""12"" and on par with ""11"", if not a little better. The cast know their characters so well by this point and have a great chemistry. You know that they had fun making this movie, and it shows. The action is minimum, but interest is sustained through following their plan as it comes to fruition. There are some twists, but nothing earth-shattering. Mostly, this is a chance to see good actors doing their thing. Fans of this series will not be disappointed, and although director Steven Soderbergh says this is the last one, I can't help but hope that he changes his mind."
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Tight, sharp, taut--classic film noir The short (73 minutes) of this film is not a problem at all; Anthony Mann's direction is so strong that there's no wasted moment. While some films noir suffer from being overly stiff (cf. The Big Combo), this one's fluidity is definitely in evidence. John Ireland is the standout here, but the two female leads--Sheila Ryan and Jane Randolph--are almost as good. A real plus, plotwise, is the 'good girl' falling (at least temporarily) for the bad guy.Similarly, the 'bad girl' ultimately turns good. These reversals, coupled with the bad guy's peculiar behavior (the infamous perfuming of his bullets) and an unusual shoot-out in a long-after-closing bar full of upside-down barstools make for an interesting film.Hugh Beaumont's good guy cop is a well-matched foil to John Ireland's Duke Martin, whose occasionally drunk girlfriend meets with Beaumont, near the end, to rat out what she thinks is her two-timing boyfriend.Definitely one of the better films noir on DVD."

When I first saw this item the memories of the glory days of Ren & Stempy washed over me, however this is nothing like the good ol' days. The whole thing is nothing but sex and fart jokes. Now I like fart jokes but not when they are 15 minutes long. Horrably annoying cartoon women bouncing around for half the cartoon is not my idea of funny. Of course, is not sexy, it's just creepy. Lastly, half of these cartoons seem to be nothing more than inside jokes and stories from the cartoonists. Only amusing if you are really into the behind the scenes scene, completely bored and confusing to the rest. Ren & Stempy's quality died after Nick canned the show way back when and it's only gotten worst."

It was very sweet, soft and calm. So I decided to give this albumn a try. At first I was disappointed because I couldn't find anything outstanding with her songs. Nothing in particular catches my attention throughout the entire albumn. I could let this CD run on the background for hours without even noticing it because it just doesn't sparkle. All songs sound similar, soft, slow and calm.Now however, I've listened for the CD for two days now and some songs start to grow on me. So if you are looking for an albumn of catchy sing-along songs, this one is definitely not for you. But you are one of those people who can chew on the songs for a long time, I recommend this CD.I still enjoy Sarah Mclahlan's voice. It is very pleasant to listen to.

I took this to a nearby shop and had them look at it. The guy there really knows his stuff, and after several minutes of experimentation, he found the problem.The hole in the trigger that holds the retaining pin for the trigger return spring is too large. The pin falls out after working the return spring a few times. The one for the original trigger is much tighter and can only be pushed out with a small tool. The solution? A larger pin, or rather, clamp the pin in a vise and flatten it a little.I gave it a 3 star because it is a good product, aside from the one manufacturing flaw.P.s.

I won't even bother going into detail on the spelling and spacing in the book that in and of itself is hurtful to his credibility.I can only conclude that Mr.Wegner was suffering from visual delusions during his employment with Mr. Jackson and had great hopes of wealth from his attempt at writing a book about a man who has given so much of his time and wealth to the needy selflessly.

My son put it together, he said it wasn't hard. I've already rode it...very nice. I also own a mountain bike. When I would ride my mountain bike, other bikers would pass me...the mountain bike is heavy. The Schwinn Katana is very light...about 20 lbs. The brakes and the gears need minor adjustment, but no big deal. It cruises very smoothly. I can pedal with the same strength as my mountain bike, but the Katana goes soooo much faster!It's very nice looking too. The only thing I didn't like was the handle bars were too low.I'm glad I made the purchase."

I do think, however, that Motown has many many unreleased gems that could have been included here and are not. Case in point, Paul's magnificent ""Last One Out"" (w/ the Tempts) which appears on the '99 release ""Lost and Found, You've Got to Earn It"" would fit here nicely. Or Dennis' ""What Become Of the Brokenhearted"". But what is here is great and representative of what made/makes Paul, Eddie, David and Dennis great vocalists and not just great Temptations group members. Great songs ""Soul Mate"", ""Johnnie Mae"", ""Statute of a Fool"", ""Don't Look Any Further"", ""Can I"" ""Once You Had A Heart"" the list goes on and on. A 3rd CD could have been added easily for me. I guess like James Brown, ""I'm a Greedy Man""."

There is a lot of business, several conversations, but one can never forget that this is just a book - and an unconvincing one at that. Wolf runs into the same problems and even uses the same dialogue as 19th century detectives (only jazzed up with techojargon). Unfortunately it appears that this story duo will become a trio."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","show, don't tell As others have noted, this book doesn't nearly capture the energy of the movie. One major problem is that DeCandido often violates the cardinal rule of good writing: show, don't tell. There are way too many scenes in which DeCandido fills space by telling you what's going on in a character's head, stating the obvious in often obvious ways. For example, we know that Jayne often is trigger-happy. Did we really need DeCandido as the narrative voice to tell us that's what Jayne is thinking at a particular time?Tie-in novels work best and have lasting value if they tell the story of the movie in a new way or add new material (Matt Stover's Revenge of the Sith novelization is still the gold standard for movie tie-ins). By contrast, you can get everything you'll want out of the story by watching the movie and deleted scenes."

One must be insane to spend US$ 17,98 on this album, which had the ""clever"" idea of printing ALL the lyrics backwards, to make them annoying (and impossible) to read. I don't know who supplied Bruce Dickinson with this fantastic idea...Maybe it was Bruce himself...It's hard to decide which is the worst Dickinson solo album: Balls To Picasso or Skunkworks. I think Skunkworks win the prize, cause Balls to Picasso has ""Tears Of The Dragon"" in it, and that song alone makes the album worth.Even so, SKUNKWORKS has its good moments. It shows once again that Bruce has a much more open and immaginative mind than his pals from Iron Maiden, and he tries a lot of new stuff here. Some of them work, others don't."

You have to think a little bit on some of the moves that have multiple steps. I gave it 3 stars because I wish he would have given a bit more instruction on the more complex moves. Also, there were some moves that were a bit awkward in the video. I will say that my favorite Tae Bo DVD is Tae Bo Amped, Full Throttle. S.O.S. isn't as intense as that one but it's still decent.

Now, I've seen a lot of reviews listed discussing how this album doesn't reflect the rough, anger-fueled music of the Linkin Park of the past, and after my first listen this is the same feeling I had.But then I gave it another shot. And another. I gave it time to soak into my mind. I asked myself, ""Why did Linkin Park decide to take this lighter sound?"". Then I realized that they decided to take the approach of letting the lyrics speak for themselves instead of forcing the sound into the listener. Give this album some time, look past what it is missing from the older Linkin Park albums and see what it has gained. I have done this and I believe that ""Minutes to Midnight"" is as good as ""Meteora""."

I hope to read more of this author's works!
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","eh, good seller, but product doesn't work There is not a thing wrong with the ring itself, it is exactly what I thought I was getting and showed up on time. But it doesn't serve it's purpose well. Because the plastic of the ring is so long (it slides around and catches on things a lot) and a little abrasive(like a thick gauge fishing wire) I ended up with an infection anyway that I didn't seem to be able to clear no matter what I used to clean it, without giving up and taking the ring out. I have had my piercing for 10 years and never an infection even though I have not always used rings made of appropriate metals or taken great care, but this ring irritated within hours. Possibly if you start using it soon enough the skin will toughen to it and you can avoid this, but because my belly was already pretty big when I switched to this one, the ring would rub and really had no hope of working."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Tragic design flaw Just wanted to add another confirmation that this camera is mechanically flawed. The design of the control dial/shutter button assembly is horrendous (which you'll get to see for yourself once it breaks off if you buy this camera). Basically, when you turn the dial, you're exerting lots of pressure against 4 tiny plastic pins that hold the dial assembly together. In my case, the dial broke off just after the warranty expired. Having called around, it sounds like it'd be a minimum of $150 to fix it, including shipping. And even if it were fixed, I think its safe to assume it would break again in a year or so."

Includes river and reservoir narratives, hatch charts, flies to use, nearby ammenities, lodging, campgrounds, maps, etc. Just FYI, my older version doesn't get to the level of labeling the fishing holes.

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Not worth the money This book was quite a disappointment. What little bits of new information you might glean were buried in disorganized details. Example of two sentences from page 192 on the role of the queen's family: ""Richard II was more fortunate, and perhaps more careful, with his half-brothers than Henry III had been. John Holland and his nephew Thomas Holland were members of Richard's inner circle in the 1390s, but were spared by Henry IV, probably at least in part because John had married Henry's sister Elizabeth, but possibly also because their influence over the king was not considered as malign as that of the chamber knights of the 1380s, nor had Richard aroused resentment against them by so heaping them with honours as he had his cousin the earl of Ruland or William le Scrope.""

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Great varied Tiny Bell Trio ""Constellations"" opens with the title track, a fairly straightforward catchy song. A lot of Dave Douglas discs start with a catchy one, and this is no exception. ""Unhooking The Safety Net"" has an Eastern European feel to the melody, and is free-jazzy. ""Hope Ring True"" is fairly free, though there's a theme running through it. You can hear very quickly that the band is very tight - this CD was recorded mid-tour. ""Taking Sides"" is a highlight with some great improv. ""The Gig"" is a Herbie Nichols song that's been delightfully dismantled and reassembled on the fly. I've seen a few jazz writers say this is one of the best CD's of the 90's. Unfortunately for me, I don't like the next three songs as much, taking this out of the running. ""Vanitatus Vanitatum"" closes the CD out in humorous fashion.If you like Dave Douglas, the Tiny Bell Trio, or modern jazz, I recommend this. I'm not sure it's one of the best of the '90's, but it's good."

I think you would be just as well off buying the old version. It seems to be the same. It seems the LP writers didn't do their homework this time around."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","The weakest Sabbath album with Ozzy Technical Ecstasy isn't classic material but it's not a really bad album, Backstreet Kids, Dirty Women and Gypsy are the good stuff, It's Alright (which features the debut of Bill Ward on vocals) sounds more like a Barry Manilow/Paul McCartney pop ballad and it doesn't have that Sabbath feel to it, but overall Techincal Ecstasy doesn't deserve to be putdown cause they say it's bad compared to Paranoid but it's great that Black Sabbath can do anything else than heavy metal, If you a heavy metal fan than you shouldn't get this album and if a beginner with Black Sabbath, get Paranoid or Master of Reality first, then work your way up. Only recommended for diehard Black Sabbath fans."

I don't think it lived totally up to the hype. Most of my friends watched it after me. Not a lot said about it, usually not a good sign. What else to say?

Incredible next-shot speed (almost no time at all), large screen, good handling, excellent compact size that permits you to take the camera anywhere, good value.So I'm not all that unhappy, but I wish the camera were more consistent and could focus better."

""Kimjongilia"" is composed of interviews with real heroes- those who have escaped North Korea and are brave in denouncing the tyrannical regime. Forget Superman, Batman, or the Avengers- these people have lived in harrowing circumstances. One survivor was born in the ominously named ""Total Control Camp""-another was imprisoned because her friend was a lover of Kim Jong-Il and knew the pillow talk. One survivor found spiritual sustenance in literature likeAnna Karenina,Resurrection (Oxford World's Classics), and was inspired byThe Count of Monte Cristoto escape.

In addition, like virtually all the books in this series, it contains factual errors--""no two snowflakes are alike."" That's substituting folklore for fact, which is common with these books.The good points:-The illustrations are lovely-There is a brief, accurate (as far as it goes) description of fog, rainbows, and snow (""ice crystals"")-There is a discussion of the seasons, even if all the details are unlikely to match your climate.This saves it--barely--from one star."

I was interested in listening to this CD after I heard the first two singles ""What you waitin for"" and ""Holla Back"", Im up for a little poptronica with some absurd gangster influence.After listening to this album, I was really dissappointed though.Stefani seems to be trying to be an 80's Madonna ressurection, which, in my book, is near the equivilant of summoning the anti-christ. Fashion and money obsessed, Stefani comes across strongly as a modern material girl, with a crush on Japan, and who likes to bring up her adventures in the back seats of cars as a reoccuring theme. And please tell me she's trying to be funny with all the white-girl gangster talk.So if you like 80's era Madonna, you will probobly like this.

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","eyes sore I have read 3 of Anne Lamott's books and was profoundly discouraged with this writing. Although I wanted so much to get to know the characters and enter in to their life, I couldn't get past their lack of nobility and/or dignity with the way they chose to live. And for a grown woman to have such a close relationship with a young girl in this novel? Totally inappropriate, especially in these fragile times.I work with college students and I want them to be inspired, championed, held accountable and victorious over the imperfection that life throws their way. I hated seeing life through the lens of this book; I don't know anyone like the characters in Hard Laughter in the 17 years I have worked in academia, and I hope I never do. It is one thing to write with raw authenticity that propels the reader to live with dignity, and something entirely different to read human mistake after human mistake after human mistake and never change the course of their trajectory. Very sad indeed."

I would almost say that my favorite feature is the cord. Unlike other sport headphones, this cord is a bit thicker and stiffer. Where some might consider this a detriment, I find that it makes the cord much less likely to tangle when not in use. I highly suggest these headphones. The quality and price make this a great buy."

In fact, the different perspective may make it more valuable than the Fodors/Frommer's standards. The Guide for the Sunshine State is no exception. Much more honest and balanced than most guides, it pulls no punches and comes off genuine in its recommendations. When the writers don't care for something, they say so. It's a refreshing change from the glossy chamber-of-commerce copy that is typical in most travel guides. While nothing revolutionary, this series is definitely a cut above the norm."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","All Star Baseball is OK THis game is not that good or bad. The graphics are sweat and if you like baseball the gameplay is cool. What i dont like about the game is the bad camra angels and how hard it is to get a realistic game i have started a season with the reds and after 5 games Griffy has 12 homeruns but my team has not won a game. Also this games roster mode is relly bad you cant do 2 for 1 trades witch doesnt allow you to trade for some big names. The things I like about the game is pitching it is hard when you start out but after a while you will get the hang of it. If you are a die hard baseball fan like me you will see that you have to know the game to be able to pull off some wins. I am sitll learning the game but in time i think i will get better. So all in all the game was not the worst baseball game of the season ""that goes to high heat baseball"" Next year i think the game will be better."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A good review of the beginnings of the second world was...but tedious on occasion In this first volume, Churchill vividly describes the fateful years of Hitler's rise to power and outlines how the debacle of the ending of the first world war allowed Hitler to come to power. However, I give the book only three stars as I found some of the reading very tedious with respect to all the letters and speeches he gave and,thus, printed here. Many of the letters he wrote to various statesmen I found a bit boring, although, some readers may find them fascinating. Several of his letters are quite remarkable with his predictions as to what will happen in the years to come. Secondly, with his exceptional command of British English and sentence structure, I found the reading, sometimes, a bit laborious. Just keep in mind that, I think, British English and proper sentence structure read differently than American English. In saying that though, I plan on finishing the remaining five volumes."

While he impresses with the scope of literature survey on the issue, Cohen fails to produce a thesis of any remark, or even coherence, from that wide reading. A great book if (1) you want to use it as a source book or (2)want to know what stereotypes have plagued America's understanding of India, for the author regurgitates a lot of such stereotypes. The book makes notable departures from mediocrity, as when it discusses Nehruvian antecedents to Indias present policy, but is on the whole uninspired. If the book is any barometer of USA's views on India, the future of the US-India alliance is not very bright."

So, if you're scanning a 10-page doc and it misses one somewhere along the way, have you really accomplished anything? No. You must either try the whole thing again (with likely the same result), or you must figure out what page(s) is missing, scan it separately, and go thru a simple yet not expedient Acrobat process to insert the omitted page. In the end, this machine made it +90% of the way to being a really great product, but the shortcoming fouls half the machine's overall utility. Swing a little bit harder next time Fujitsu."

I was disappointed. This version contains no table of contents (linked or otherwise), no interpretive introduction or footnotes, and none of the contemporary illustrations.

Yun Fat Chow and ZHang Ziyi's fight scene in the forest near the end was one of the scenes that I thought was very memorable..)It is not a typical Hollywood comedy-martial arts film like Rush Hour or anything, but I think the director did a fantastic job with this film.I highly recommend it for anyone."

At the time I Just thought my professor was jealous because he is also a writer though not as well known. Once I read The Da Vinci Code, I realized he was right. Dan Brown has a very simplistic style of writing. I did like the fact that he kept his chapters fairly short, but the way he goes back and forth between characters and point of view is tiresome after a while. As for the plot, it started out alright, but towards the end it just got so predictable. I knew exactly how Brown was going to end it and who play what role in the outcome. It was an okay read but I don't think it lives up to the hype."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","All that Joplin wanted was for it to be recognised Throughout Joplin's short 49 year long life, all he wanted to do was put forward the seriousness of ragtime, such an effect was achieved in his great ragtime opera ""Treemonisha"", but it was never recognised during his lifetime. With the re-emergence of ragtime in the 1970's Joplin's music and its sometimes elusive melancholic power came through, inspiring this great recording. Carmen Balthrop and Betty Allen are superb, and the recording from the orchestra is first class. Joplin's goal on writing this opera was to mix ragtime with opera to show that it could be just as ""serious"" as others. It is fair to say that Joplin's attempt, as a ragtime writer and not an opera writer is impressive and admirable, just as noone would expect an opera master like Puccini or Verdi to write ragtime."

Either reevaluate whether you need a press, or try another line. If I could turn back time, I'd try Lodge (and they have new colors now to), All Clad, or one of the cheaper cheap pans.

A poorly written book with non-sensical turns in the plot development. For instance, a female reporter shows up to help the central character in Europe. She saves his life because she is packing a pistol and happens to be a crack shot. Even in 1983 it was not likely anyone packed a pistol in Europe. She could not have brought it from the states and almost impossible to purchase one in Europe. Well, the book goes on and on like that."

Assembly was hassle-free. I was intimidated by the cooking instructions at first but once you start following along it all makes sense. We purchased the hardwood charcoal based on another raters recommendation and love it. The food cooked on the Weber Performer is fabulous!I cannot get over the difference in taste along with how moist the meat is if you follow the directions; don't pierce the meat, don't cook without the lid and let the food rest for a few minutes after removing from grill.

Of all the neo-soul artists out in the last 5+ years, I probably have listened to Bilal, D'Angelo and Musiq most. However, I am especially impressed with Musiq's ability to crank out records every 2 years of solid to excellent quality. Many of the other neo-soulers seem to be struggling with doing this (I'm sure for various reasons - writer block; record company problems; etc). He reminds me of the time when Marvin, Steve, Aretha and others got product out every 1-2 years. And, today it's even harder since an entire album must consist of strong cuts, unlike the 60's when you could do a strong single or two plus fillers for the rest of the album (of course not to say there weren't many great 60's albums).

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Great book, BUT.... I play violin & viola and purchased this book for a lesson plan for one of my education courses. The only ""issue"" you could say, that I have with this book is the example that is given for the viola track. 45 seconds of a concerto that makes it sound like a violin (the Bartok finale!). They could have chosen a better clip to use (like say the Telemann). haha! Maybe I'm a bit bias.The book is great with all things aside, and very informative for those that know nothing of the orchestra. It's too bad they don't list the performers on the CD! Don't let my bias deter you from purchasing this book! It's great for kids!"

Harrison Ford is essential lifeless. Well, a corpse might act a bit better. And Julia Ormond looks like she is in a trance the whole time. Now, I would submit that Humphrey Bogart was also unappealing to me in the original, but at least Audrey Hepburn could carry the film. No such luck here. I could not have been more disappointed."

I've been wanting to upgrade to a Digital SLR and believed the great reviews. I've been terribly disappointed with the pictures... all seem far to dark and dull. Doesn't seem to mater which lens or what type of lighting. I'm checking with Canon to see if maybe there is a problem with the camera... if not, I would say this is an awful investment. If you have time to work in the advanced modes, maybe you can find a setting that takes clear, crisp picture; but if you are using in any of the basic modes, you have no control over the results."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",Save your money! I bought this product for the times when the edges of my garden bed and grass around my foundation need a little trim in between weed whacking. This product requires a lot of work for minimal results. The blades are not very sharp and I found it difficult to trim grass close to the foundation. I do not advise trying to cut more than 5 blades of grass at a time. It guess its back to full time weed whacking.
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Stay away! This book is jumpy, and makes very rough and incomprehensive transitions from simple topics to more complicated ones. Very inconsistant, and often times, incorrect use of terms, which can really throw you off when you're trying to learn a programming language. The worst part is that the author does not explain many parts of the code that for some reason, he assumes you already know. One thing I've learned from these reviews, is to not just look at the rating, but also reviews that cover aspects that are important to you. The high ratings from this book came mostly from more experienced programmers that just needed a reference or some quick scripts. The bad reviews came mostly from begginers who quickly turned away by the author's vague tone. Judging by the title, and even the first chapter, this book markets itself as a beginner's tool which it is not. I picked up Sams Teach Yourself Active Server Pages in 21 Days, and it's a much better publication."

He seems to sleep walk through his life with caual ease, whilst carrying out such dark deeds.The irony is that he has a sentimental heart which ultimately leads to his own disaster.I enjoyed this book very much; it draws you into its sleazy heart with consumate skill: introducing a world of cheapness in every turn.People get killed but no one cares... least of all the reader, it's as if we have quickly learned that some lives are not worth anything. It's a lie of course but we believe it without realising that we too have been numbed by what we see.I recommend this as tale, full of irony and extremely well written."

The gusset where the center pole met the roof broke the second time I put it up, it wasn't tightened properly but amazon was really good about the return process. This tent wasn't right for me but if you live in an area with soil that accepts stakes well and make sure to tighten/check the gusset it could be right for you."

I am very pleased with the Perzl Tikka light. Although I am an outdoor activist I bought the light to use around the house. It frees up my hands to do things in dim light. Much better than a hand flashlight. The product is well made, light, and very comfortable on the head. The illumination of the lamp is sufficient for my needs."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","An average book by a good mathematician This is one of the worst undergraduate algebra texts I've ever seen. Although everything Jacobson says in his book is true, his writing style makes the material seem more difficult than it really is. Many results in the book are not numbered or highlighted from the rest of the book, and this makes it virtually impossible to retrieve information when needed. In order to find the result you want you probably need to read the entire section to find it. This book is a counter example to the following conjecture: If a person is a good mathematician, then he writes good mathematics textbooks."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",Not the best I didn't find this book as helpful as I had wished.

I love this book because every little part of it is very interesting and you are hooked to it the whole time. It has a little mystery, some action, and the author is good at descriptions.

Everyone was pretty on their game in this film. The visuals were pretty good too, they kept the movie creepy in a classic way.The bad; the plot. Maybe I've seen too many ghost stories but how many times can we learn the lesson, gold leads to dead cursed stuff. The movie was well written for what it was but it wasn't much. Cheap scares all done before with little variation. Personally it's a film I'm not likely to remember in 6 months unless I see the cover again."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Not bad, but not great either. Watch it for the girlfight. I love Ice Cube! He is so hot, even during his NWA days. This movie was okay. It has an unrealistic story of a young and very attractive woman who becomes a teen mom, leaves home and supports herself as a stripper. She attends college and falls asleep in class, yet unbelievably manages to graduate and become, as the ending implies, a reputable journalist.There is a very graphic and disturbing rape scene that makes me cringe just thinking about it.The best part of the movie was the wicked girl fight! It makes me wish that I could kick my ex-boyfriend's a$$ like that!"
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Very Disappointing I wanted to purchase this book for my husband's birthday. I went looking for it at a local bookstore after discovering it here on amazon and reading the great reviews - we are both lovers of Tollkien's works. My first reaction was - 'gee, its tiny' - being only slightly bigger than a pocket size book. Then I looked more closely. A hardcover, yes, but nothing spectacular in quality. The pictures are sweet, light and airy, but I expected more. And as for the verse - I also expected there to be more. It is well written, but very brief. Four brief lines of verse on each right-hand page, while the page on the left was an illustration. I didn't stand there and count lines of text, but since there are maybe 24 pages in the book total, that would make it 12 pages of text or 48 short lines of verse in the whole book. It could have been printed on one or two pages and still been surrounded by lovely illustrations.It's just not worth the money in my book - no pun intended."

I just want to run my own bakery without going into debt... do it the Dave Ramsey way, if you know what I mean.If you are opening a bigger bakery or baking isn't your passion, but you think you can make money in it, then this is the book for you.

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","No real bonus My review for the no-bonus track version has also been used on this one. However, I should point out that the original version is superior to this one. Bonus tracks are generally a mixed bag, and with a live album probably more so. Thus, a once decent album is junked up with pretty disposable extra live tracks. I can't see anything to recommend this version, songs like ""Straighten Out"" and ""Peaches"" sound odd when out of their original late 70's context."

The fast pace of Kurts guitar riffs is here and many of the songs are so short that it's easy to miss them but as long as you listen to this album with an open mind you can hear it for it's individuality, just don't expect it to be much like the other fine Pups offerings.

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Disappointment guaranteed I bought this cd for two reasons. Firstly, it is a product of the cool Upstairs Records, which has brought out worthwhile artists such as The Verbrlli Sound Experience, (aka Telefuzz) and others. Also because I read that the artist is a fan of Genesis and Yes. On the basis of this I thought that at least melody would not be an issue.Well, I was wrong. I have not been able to trace one memorable melody on the entire cd. Neither is there anything original to redeem this fact, if you accept ambient/electronic music as an established genre. Virtually every track starts of with a spoken introduction, to the point that one has to question artistic integrity,if it is remembered that it was the exact modus operandi of The Irresistible Force.Eventualy the feeling is confirmed that Gel-Sol cannot produce anything but by inane repetition."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",The book gives an overview of writing for new media. I am somewhat disappointed in what the book covers.

Like a can of Cola left open for two years, it's gone rather flat and sticky. Take the wow-ee-zow-ee drum and bass machine out of it and what do you have? A pretty amazing instrumentalist who loves his weed (see the liner notes). I wonder what Martyn would sound like sober and solo. A whiter shade of pale, perhaps?

I felt for Netta in the beginning when she was trying to survive I did not like her greedy, gold-digging ways I also did not like what she did to Black which she paid a heavenly price for but i glad she found love in Tone even though it ended up being tragic in the end but that goes to show what goes around comes around. Black was a man not to be played with I found him to be ruthless to some extent I felt for him especially when Netta betrayed him but he took it too far and also paid for it in the end. Mimi was a sad case I didn't like how she was very envious of Netta but that goes to show you beauty is only skin deep you have to love who you are on the inside and not look for someone to love you first.

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",Not what I had hoped for I love Linda Howard...usually. Lately her work has not been up to par. Most of her recent books have seemed rushed and not well thought out. The stories are good but they are just lacking depth or something. I have a hard time conecting with the characters. Howard's older works (mostly written in the 80's) like the Mackenzie books and Angel Creek and Lady of the West were so passionate and I really connected with the characters. If this is your first Linda Howard book you might be dissapointed. Go back and read her earlier works. You will enjoy them more. Sarah's Child is a real tear jerker and I love that style. I wish she would go back to it. I would also love to see another western. Howard is a good author but she needs to revisit what works best and not this new stuff she has been experimenting with.

Maybe just cable internet was bogged down, but Netflix was working just fine at the same time, so not sure what to think.Either way, the movie was a bit slow at times and hard to follow. It seemed like the movie relied on your prior knowledge of the characters and who they are to really appreciate what the movie was trying to do at times. My Girlfriend had to explain characters and who they were in order to make it all come together. I started falling asleep after about 1:45 in, so I can't rate how it finished. I can tell you that it's nothing like Gladiator as one of the reviews stated. lol"

They worked great for a while, however, the Pilot Point Tip eventually lots its bite. With a dull Pilot Point Tip the drill bit will simply spin on top of the surface you're drilling. So once the Tip is dull you'll either need to sharpen it, which is difficult because its so small, or throw away the bit.Its a real shame because until the tip dulled the bits did a fantastic job. However, I'm switching back to a standard tip drill bit."

As the liner notes aptly state: ""if it fails to stir the intellect, it sets the pulses tingling."" The opening Moderato does indeed tingle. The playing on the Adante is exceptional. Pianist Piers Lane acquits himself very well of the Scherzo. The finale is ravishing.The Moszkowski is coupled with Paderewski's Piano Concerto in A minor. A little less refined and more bombastic than the Moszkowski, it also is deserving of a wider audience.Piers Lane does a wonderful job on the entire disc. The BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Jerzy Maksymiuk, handles the task at hand in a creative and faithful manner.Hyperion deserves laurels for unearthing these gems. I recommend this disc."

I was sorely disappointed.While Sabrina Jeffries is known as as bestselling author, this was obviously not one of her best. I didn't like Gideon Horn's (our hero) take-over attitude nor did I care for his bitter attitude. He wasn't really a likable character. And while Sara Willis (our heroine) had a great personality--strong, independent, vulnerable--I wasn't buying into her attraction to Gideon. A reformer who falls in love with a pirate? It's a great concept, but the actual plot was a bit lacking. I think Jeffries could have written this with a little more...flair, I think, is the word I'm looking for."

I rarely get a chance to see his show so this book was perfect for me.When Miller was making headlines this summer with his addition to MNF I thought I'd get his latest rants. I was glad I did. The thing I like about this book is that you can pick it up at anytime and have yourself a good laugh. Each chapter is only 4-5 pages long. You don't have to remember what you read the last time you picked up the book because each chapter is a different rant.The only thing I didn't like about this book is that it is all from the tv show. So there is no original material here. If I happened to have seen that episode the book isn't quite as funny.Overall, if you are a Dennis Miller fan, it is definitely worth the price. But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong!"

It's not about Lenny Bruce! In fact, at best, he's a bit part in a not-so-interesting story about this Thomas guy (Lenny talks about him a little in his writings here and there, but he's just another guy in the life of Lenny). If you're interest in the author, get the book. If you're interested in Lenny Bruce, there are a least ten books that you should read before this, mostly, non Lenny literature."

It was only after I finished a publication design class and came back to the book that it struck me--GCN is set in a display typeface (which one I don't know) that makes it excruciatingly difficult for me to read.I honestly can't say whether the advice is any good or not. I am someone who flies through books; when they are well-designed, it's not uncommon to read two a night.

[Inside a box; inside of a state; inside of a country.]The artwork is colorful and appealing, the children seem personable enough, and my children (3 and 5; boy and girl) liked the story enough to hear it through a few times, but the ""Booklist"" reviewer was right in that it seems a little long.In addition, I would add that there is only so much interest that can be aroused by what's inside another thing.

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","OK case if you're willing to finish manufacturing it This case arrived in good condition, but was deformed when manufactured. The bottom bowed downward in the center about 3/4 inch and rocked back and forth on the floor. My wife asked me to make a close-fitting base for her Brother model 1034D serger. I cut a piece of plywood and two 2x2x4 inch bumpers from 2x2 wood. I covered all with thick felt and fastened the base to the floor of the case with one bolt in the center. The internal base holds the serger in place and also flattens the floor of the case. IF YOU'RE NOT HANDY WITH FIXING DEFORMED PLASTIC PRODUCTS, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CASE. I'M ALSO SORRY TO SAY THAT THIS CASE IS MADE IN THE US... QUALITY CONTROL ON THIS PRODUCT LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Pictoral Trip to Greece This is a great book for the traveler on a medium budget interested in a pictoral trip to the islands. The book rates the sights and gives highlights in each town without getting you bogged down with too many details about specific museum exhibits or lists of every possible tourist attraction. Such an overview is especially valuable to the first-time traveler. Detailed maps of the different islands show main driving routes. The colored town maps are abbreviated, making it easy to check for key spots. Extra tidbits of information about writers and historical facts are given in sidebars. The small but generous number of pictures gives you a feel for where you might like to go."

While it is good at the ""identifying"" and ""understanding"" parts, it leaves something to be desired in the ""attracting"" department. I had hoped for a book that would tell me what has a good chance of drawing specific birds, but except for hummingbirds, it really doesn't go into detail about the topic. It's still a good book as far as it goes; I simply don't think that it's much of a guide to attracting the specific birds you have reason to believe are in your area, but goes with a considerably more general approach."

It is sometimes shock, sometimes hilarious, sometimes violent and sometimes sexy. Absolutely highly recommended and one of the best in the genre.I am now having a new series of books waiting for me to read, together with Alex Cross and Lincoln Rhyme and Harry Bosch series."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",The Perfect Book? No. The Perfect Storm reads like two books:The first book is like a soap opera and follows the lives of a group of doomed fishermen who lead nomadic lives that go something like this: Fish...party....fish...drink...fight...fish..divorce...fish..etc.The second book is a exciting tense tale of courage and loss. The helicopter rescue attempt and subsequent ditching is great story telling. The author's narrative of the building storm is impressive. How anyone survived is almost beyond belief.The author interweaves these two accounts. One leaves you with a sense of awe and tragedy. The other is bound to be a made for tv mini-series.

The only thing you can do is take off the front wheel and that doesn't even help much. So unless you plan on starting your run from your driveway, thats the only way you are gonna get it to travel anywhere with you.

There was very little surround to it, but after all, the source was not surround to begin with.The extras area decent with a couple of commentaries and a half hour documentary about the making of the film, going over the casting, problems with the filming in Paris and the Hayes code restrictions and getting around them. A documentary short and a Tom and Jerry cartoon round out the extras, plus a theatrical trailer for the movie.Gigi is a classic movie that has a beautiful release on blu-ray with this disc."

It is definitely solid black and will work very well to maintain regulation standards. It is a very roomy bag and feels more durable than I thought it would.

It has special features (like a Presidential trading card) and interviews with Martin Luther King III, George Lopez, and more. It's so well made that I was even more impressed AFTER I watched it at how incredible Obama and the campaign have been. I've heard that it officially comes out Inauguration Day--January 20th.

While attempting to clean out the cutters the screw holding one end cap fell out (it had been ratting since I got it) and despite repeated attempts the cutter seized up.Fine machine for determining if you really want to make your own pasta at home as a first-timer, but not good for long-term use."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Great System but Unreliable Microsoft is now sending me my THIRD Xbox 360 system in as many months. Every system I've had has experienced freezing problems, locking up on just about every game I own. Sometimes the system doesnt recognize 360 discs as games, prompting me to ""insert this disc into an Xbox 360 console."" (And yes, the system and power supply is ventilated, and the discs are new and scratch free). To Microsoft's credit, I have not had to pay an extra dime for any of this. They have paid for all the shipping and have had the replacements sent to me quickly (within 5 days), and their support department has been generally pleasant to deal with and almost overly-apologetic. I'm happy about that, however, I would like to own one of these things for longer than 30 days without it locking up on me. When it works the system is amazing, but its a typical Microsoft product with its ""sell it now, fix it later"" mentality."

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A Must Read for All Dog People! In each of her stories, Margot Woods has captured the essence of the human-dog relationship, and the importance of good training in enhancing that relationship. Her stories depict everything from the frustration both handler and dog exhibit when there is no training and hence, no communication between the species to the amazingly strong bond that is forged with proper training and communication. Everyone who has a ""problem"" dog should read this book for insight. Everyone who has a ""good"" dog should read this book to see how much better their dog can be. And, for those few people who have the kind of relationship with their dog that Ms Woods helps her students achieve, reading this book will have you nodding your head in understanding, laughing in delight and shedding the occasional tear. A must read for all dog lovers, whether pet owner or professional trainer."

I finally saw this movie for the first time the other day, more than a year after its theatrical release to overwhelming critical acclaim, including a few Academy Awards. But I was very disappointed with it. What I saw was little more than a sappy melodrama, laced with superb acting performances but badly flawed by a hokey and unoriginal script. This movie is so uninspiringly melodramatic and predictable that it could have been made for TV instead of for the big screen. In fact, they make movies just like this one for Lifetime every week."

This is not the case. It's a linear smash-em-up and you don't do a lot of smashing. The camera sucks and the bosses are just drab. I feel like this game should have belonged on the ps1 instead.

Know that I am a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to sound quality, but I thought the noise-cancelling feature was more of a weak sound boost and the large noise-cancelling microphone was awkwardly placed halfway down the cord.I returned these and went back to the Bose store and purchased the QC-3's, which sound much better (clearer highs and deeper lows), have a more comfortable fit, have a built in noise-canceling microphone and a rechargeable battery. Yes, the Sennheisers are almost 1/3 the price of the Bose set, but if you're serious about sound quality and appreciate well designed functionality, then trust me, just get the Bose set - you won't regret it."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Minestrone This music is lip-smackingly rich and thick, like a really good minestrone soup. Hamelin is pianism of the first order, busily and sometimes poundingly accompanying the full orchestra through an unusal 8-part ""concerto,"" a daunting 72 minute Herculean opus. After several listenings I still haven't grasped the themes or larger architecture of this lyrical work, a great wall of background sound; it would probably take many more. It seems a generaly upbeat paean to civilization (clearest in the text of the men's chorus), with no hint of the dissolution to come in WW I. However, there is no attempt to imitate or suggest the musics of the three ancient civilizations Busoni invokes (in his frontispiece drawing) as the architectural underpinnings of this sprawling work. The notes (written in 1958) are extremely detailed, but would be more comprehensible if keyed to the timings of each long and busy movement (10-23 min each, slightly faster than ""usual"")."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Not impressed. I bought this based on the reviews, and because I thought it would be nice to attach to his stroller, or a shopping cart, but I have been disappointed. We have had this since before our son was born. The music is nice, and my son likes the colors and will occasionally walk around holding this by the handle. The big issue is: it is not interactive. The ""feet"" are too short and fat for a small child to hold (and they don't do much anyway- maybe a few textures?), and at 13 months our son still cannot turn it on or press any of the numbers (it is very difficult to get the music to play- esp. for the target age group). If we turn on the music for him, he likes it okay (esp when he was smaller), but at this age he prefers if he can do that himself. I am just not impressed with this toy. There are much better toys for texture exploration, and you can find other toys that play music on the go. This is one of our toys I would pass on if I had to do it again. HOpe this helps!"

The writers apparently forgot (or never knew) that the true persona in the Batman/BruceWayne duality is the Batman, not Bruce Wayne.

The key placement takes a little getting used to if you had been using a non ergonomic keyboard previously, but it is not as bad as those split keyboards you see that are ""true ergonomic"". The mouse has a good feel and the buttons are well positioned to me, lots of options for button remapping, even by application, so depending on the program your using, each button can have a different function. The keyboard is super quiet, but has a good solid key feel and good feedback when pressing a button, you know that you've hit it. My only con for this keyboard, is that with the way the keys are recessed inside the trim bezel, I seem to accidentally turn on the caps lock or hit the shift key under the enter, I figure this is something I can learn to avoid as I use the keyboard more."

Unfortunately, many of the songs get lost in a wash of synth-loops and other effects in a man v. machine struggle for control. The potential is certainly there once they gain enough confidence in their vocals and songwriting to let the songs and melodies breath a little more. Will they be given a chance?"

This is not even close to what I'd assemble as an ""essential"" list. Season 4 I can understand, as that was not well accepted overall. I guess I just find it hard to believe that this is truly representative of fan desires (and I've been a huge Xena fan since the show's start.) Perhaps the fans shouldn't have been involved at all! A list of shows showing Xena's evolution, starting with her appearance on Hercules, and ending with her death - and all comedy and non-arc stories generally excluded - would have gone a lot farther."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Kudos to Ray Winstone This film is stylish, edgy, and self-important. Nonetheless -- Ben Kingsley as the psychopathic gangster Don Logan is over-rated; his upstaging of the other actors is unnerving and annoying, but, thankfully, he doesn't completely get away with it. For Ray Winstone is perfectly cast and absolutely brilliant and so overshadows Kingsley even for viewers not quite aware of the feat, as does Ian McShane, whose genial laughter is beyond scary.Cinematographically daring and interesting, this is a visually memorable film. It also has many surprising and subtle touches in its portrayal of character, for instance in the tender avuncular relationship between Gal and Enrique, and in the deep love that binds Gal to his ex-porn-star wife, played magnificently by Amanda Redman. Despite its virtues, however, ""Sexy Beast"" is weakly plotted. Too much time is spent developing scenes that are tangential to the film's real energy. Its reach is longer than its grasp"

It comes with a bunch of adapters to use with most apple i_____ products. To be clear, this is not a party, porch, outdoor system. It will distort if it's turned all the way up. The bass will sound like it's cutting out. But a bedside table system with a nature sounds app or Pandora set on an ambient station is magnificent. It sounds great even playing metalcore as long as it's played at a medium volume. If you want something to play at a backyard party do not buy this.

The book flows well when discussing flying characteristics of a ME-262 or some other WWII aircraft, but these areas are fewer and farther between than in Mr. Griffin's other novels. A return to action is needed for the follow-on."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Horrid little camera Bought this camera for my wife to use because I got a great deal. She didn't have it one week and it started having problems. Some deal.The first problem was that she couldn't download all the pictures without the camera shutting off. We found that in order to download the pictures from the 128MB SD memory card we had to download them 20 at a time.The second problem was the battery life. Even when using 2000mAh NiMH AA batteries we could only get about 50 shots before needing a fresh pair.Lastly the color representation was very bad. I have a picture of some flowers that I have shared here on Amazon. The blue flowers to the right of the yellow rose were really purple, not blue.I've had better luck with my older Olympus and my wife's new Canon camera. Avoid this camera like the plague."

One night, our electricity went off and the dogs went crazy. Their collars were beeping and shocking them. We had to catch them and take off the collars, then remove the batteries from the collars to make them stop going off. This happened a second time, so I called PetSafe. The customer service rep I spoke with was almost bored with my problem. I truly expected someone that would be concerned about pets and offer suggestions, but I was told to buy a battery pack. I asked if he knew of any packs that lasted over 10 hours because our electricity was off 12 hours the last time, and if we hadn't been home due to a funeral, we would have been gone for most of those 12 hours. He had no idea, just told me to check with Staples or Office Depot. I was VERY disappointed with the lack of concern on their part."

Simply put, this CD shows the current miserable state of the ""classical"" music industry.

For those of us who got hooked on the 80's TV series this book is an overdue treat. Lot's of good photo's and at least a few interesting insights into the making of the series from on of the co-stars. I was disappointed, however, in the superficial treatment given to the relationships between the show's regulars. One day perhaps we'll learn what it was really like to be cooped up on a lava rock in the middle of the Pacific with a nonstop fan contingent hungry to learn about your every move. There has to be some interesting stories in there somewhere. In any case, the book does bring back some warm memories of those Thursday nights spent in front of the tube just wishing I could be half as cool as Tom Magnum."

Also, you cannot pause or easily stop recording (unless RAM), which means it is very difficult -- virtually impossible -- to edit out commercials. Remote confusing, and mine did not work very well.

I had reservations initially with this model because by specifications it does not stand very high in the class, although its appearance is quite attractive. Its major drawback is that it does not read MP3 disks as majority of new systems by Philips do; and also the speakers do not seem to be powerful enough. However, It turned out to be quite user friendly, unpretentious and sufficiently powered for my demands. No regrets for this purchase so far, except that I feel that the basses could be more stable (speakers are unshielded) as they sometimes outperform the vocals on the recordings with mixed instrumental effects."

These are a good low to middle of the road semi-pro headphone. For $15 the sound is not bad, the highs are slightly muddy, but the bass and mid-range is pretty good. The downside of these is the comfort. They are NOT comfortable at all. They feel like hard plastic with a little bit of foam on the ear pads; and the headband is hard plastic with no foam. I'm a writer/director so I picked these up to wear while i'm on the set to monitor the audio. I don't plan on continuiously wearing them as I'll be taking them off and on throughout the shoot, so personally I don't mind the uncomfortableness.

The band gradually morphs from a terrific New Wave outfit into some sort of corporate arena-rock clone. And their songs slowly begin sounding like Heart tunes (and that is NOT a compliment, believe me).By 1986's ""Top Gun"" soundtrack, and the horrid ""Take My Breath Away"", the metamorphosis is in full swing.If you are like me, you'll want to order Berlin's first two albums (""Information"" and ""Pleasure Victim""), and skip the rest (including this greatest hits package). Even ""Masquerade"" isn't worth owning an album that contains dreck like ""Blowin' Sky High"" and ""For All Tomorrow's Lies""."

It came with 3 tips and runs like a charm. Lowes also carry the exact same model with a Honda engine for $20 more or refurbished 3000 psi washers for $199. For some reason Lowes does not show their pressure washers online so you'll have to make a trip to the store to see what they have.All the models I was interested in have the extra clear hose dip to suck from detergent bottles, but none of the models offered a valve to control the flow of the soap.

It had no suspense to it because you really can figure out who the villian is before the 2nd chapter, even with the growing dementia that MHC is sure we all suffer from.

I initially left the thermostat at the factory setting, but this gives you only a few seconds of hot water, not more than a quart.

The bike is about 75-100 lbs less than the carrying limit. The bike is relatively easy to load and take off, I can do it by my self, but that may not be true for everyone as I am a relatively tall person with circus like arms. The frame of the carrier shows some twisting as the bike is loaded onto the carrier. I am not sure if this is true with all carriers, but as there is only one central mounting point (the hitch) the shear physics of the weight on one side lead me to believe this would be the same on all carriers. The twisting goes away as soon as the bike is loaded on. It did not come with any tie down straps, but this was remedied with about 30 dollars in straps from the local true value. All in all I am very happy with the way this carrier performs and I recommend it."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Oh my, a lightly perspiring Swank! The main problem with The Reaping is that it's entirely derivative: the basic premise is one that has been covered many times before. The film certainly looks good: you can't fault the production from a visual point of view, but what Hollywood fails to realise time and time again is that effects alone do not a movie make. The CGI is very good, with some particularly convincing digital locusts, but it's all too `in your face' and along with the tired plot line and cardboard characters, the film never engages the viewer and therefore fails to scare or shock. The overblown ending is especially unsubtle and unconvincing. There's only one revelation here and that's how sexy Hilary Swank can be!"
5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","everything I needed This album blends elements of RnB, Hip-hop, Pop, and Neo-soul over a spanish guitar to create the total package. When it was released in the US in 2001 it was at a time when urban/pop music was stale and everyone was trying to be an RnB Thug. This is one of those albums you can play all the way through, the songs flow together so well that its almost a concept album. Tales of young love, heartbreak, good times, romance,and moments of mature reflection abound. I didn't expect to like the songs Booty Man because of the title but Craig David can make anything he sings over an acoustic guitar sound lush and romantic, even if its the the exploits of a guy at a club. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. 4 years later I can still play this album and smile. Future classics include You Know What, Walking Away, Fill Me In, 7 days, Rendezvous, and Bootyman."

My condition isn't what you would call severe, just inconvenient. At the same time I began taking Venapro, I also enacted some lifestyle changes: drinking lots of water, taking a fiber supplement, icing the area, using Tucks pads, taking ibuprofen to reduce swelling, and eating healthy foods. Even after all of this, I still have not noticed a difference. Maybe I am just a tough case, and like I said, maybe Venapro is a life saver for some folks. Just not for me. No adverse side effects, though."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","To be avoided When it works, it works very well. Unfortunately, it seems to spend most of its time trying to pair with other Bluetooth devices (mobile phones?) resulting in numerous breaks in the music. Sat quietly with no-one near you it is excellent, but on a crowded train or walking down busy streets it is awful. The constant breaks in playback make it unusable. I know it's not the Sony Bluetooth headset, because if I pair them to my phone or Mac I have no issues with breaks of service. Even on busy trains.Another gripe is the battery; it lasts about 6 hours, but is very poor at keeping the charge. If you don't use it for a few days you will need to charge it up again as the battery will be flat. And yes, I always turn the unit off when I have finished with it - the battery just runs down."

The bottom, sized all wrong. My weight is very evenly distributed, and I'm not bottom-heavy or anything. I really wish the bottom was bigger. I tried it on, and couldn't get it past my thighs. The bottom looks very small when you hold it up, especially to be called a 2-3x. I bought this big on purpose. I figured it would last a little longer if I got it bigger. However, the full set doesn't fit properly.The vinyl does seem very sturdy, like you can at least wear it about eight-plus times with care. But it looks like I'll wear just the top.

If you like strange movies that don't make sense until the last scene, then this is your type of movie. It does just that. You can guess throughout the movie and frequently change your mind and you will still be surprised in the end. I like it that way. I gave this movie four out of five stars."

Michael Moore hates America! He is not an asset to our country, rather he is a traitor and should be treated as one. This book itself is an excellent piece of evidence that could be used. Do not read this book, for you will be wasting your time. Instead, try something a little less liberal."

But I will still read each new book, though it's a lot easier to wait for the paperbacks, now. One thing bugs the ever living crap out of me though: what is Jordan's obsession with fashion? He spends four or five pages setting up every scene by describing EXACTLY what each person, important or not, is wearing down to the buttons (LITERALLY, HE DESCRIBES THE BUTTONS!). Was he an aspiring fashion editor who's dreams were dashed? I think he created the whoel dreamworld thing solely based on the idea that people could change what they were wearing with mere thoughts, fulfilling his fantasy of describing a new outfit every 5 seconds.Anyways, this book is nothing special. If you're deep into the series, then you know what you're getting yourself into. If not, well, reading war and peace will be quicker and make you look smarter."

My opinion is that they all throw in the towel and sell their souls when they convert to the GRP religion.Larry says in the credits that this album was all about ""checking our egos at the door"" - A more accurate statement would be that they checked their improvisational flair and creativity at the door."

As for the Castro apologist, this movie is accurate both in portraying Batista's violent (and deadly) hold on power, and Castro's bloody triumph and aftermath (property confiscation scenes are very accurate).

I am writing this review having only seen about eight episodes of season one and I am still waiting for it to get funny and I honestly doubt I will watch much more. I got the first season for a great price so that is why I gave it a chance.Joel McHale is fine on The Soup. Here, he seems completely wrong and there is no chemistry with any of the cast. There are some funny moments, mostly with secondary characters, but few and far between. When does it get funny?By comparison, The Middle was immediately hilarious with great characters and writing.Now, there are a ton of extras on these dvds so that is a bonus for fans but as far as the show itself? Not funny at all. So far, anyways. I will revise if/when I watch any more of this series."

Not to mention, the lamest wisecracks this side of Adam Sandler. Don't get me wrong, there were a few good scenes. Unfortunately, it does not save the film from being just a special effects nightmare. GRADE: C-"

I was really hoping to enjoy this new author because book reviewers and critics gave winning comments. I was bored to death, pushed myself to finish reading it so I could give an accurate review, but I was very disappointed. I live in Arizona where this book is based, and actually felt like it was some kind of travel manual. There were far too many details and not enough story line.The first chapter of any novel should grab the reader and leave them wanting more. In this case, the reader has no clue what the 1st chapter has to do with the story line until long into the book. In fact, the book's description is completly misleading to the real story. The author did a poor job of giving the reader enough clues to keep the story moving. It begins with a double murder, but that isn't even the main plot. To cut to the chase.Is it worth buying?Absolutely not. In my opinion, it isn't even worth checking out from the library if that were an option."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A disappointing ""Oracle"" I have the entire collection of Paul Auster's works, and therefore would classify myself as a fan of his. This book, however, was a grave disappointment, which I found barely readable. It appears as if Auster wrote this novel, ""Oracle Night"", and found that it was too short in content. Then, to resolve the problem, he re-wrote it adding the new text as footnotes, filling in the blanks. A large percentage of this book is footnotes, comprised of smaller text, which is difficult to read and continually disturbs the pace of the story while taxing these poor senior eyes to their maximum degree. Paul Auster, cut to the chase and stop with the gimmicks. No more bold text, no more footnotes, simply tell the story in the excellent style you have developed over so many years. You will find me a gracious and appreciative reader, continuing to be one of your sincere and avid fans."

Disgusting Sex Jokes, etc...etc.Everytime they did one, I checked it off.I didn't actually laugh until the Rudolph character falls in the street in her wedding dress....That is halfway through the movie.

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","On Reflection: Good A wide range of stories of life in the slow lane of post industrial Scotland. I picked up this book in a store, tried to read it and pretty much immediately put it down for six months. I was put off by the written Scots dialect (in some (not all) of the stories), the seeming inconsequentality of some of the storylines, and the surreal nature of some others.I'm glad I picked it up again. I tried reading ""Nice to be Nice"" (written in Scots) oot loud to mysel' an' it made a lot more sense, and became an affecting story of a man working (in a small way) against bureaucracy. Reading other stories it became clear that they ARE about everyday life, but they add a poetic quality to it, and really get you inside the head of the characters.I would recommend this book."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Old School Story With A New Twist I first saw this movie a couple of years ago and finally decided to add it to my collection. If your not familiar with this film it's about a town that made a packed with a werewolf and for years things have been going as well as could be expected until the wolf changes the rules by killing ""Red's"" older sister. I liked this film because it was different from most werewolf movies as the main female charcature ""Red"" was underplayed by Amanda Seyfried so the viewer wasn't just thinking don't go in the woods. This is a combination love story, creature film, and whodonit, I think it would have done much better on it's original releas if it wasn't lost during the ""Twilight"" hype. IMHO It is a much better film than any of the twilight films because it has a more adult theme, it's not filled with graphic gore and has an old school feel."

After many times of trying to pretend that a soft cloth would clean my ice bucket, I finally broke down a polished the nasty looking thing.Another thing that concerned me is that there is no marking whatsoever on this ice bucket. I called Reed & Barton to ask about this and they said it probably was theirs but to buy direct from them from now on to be sure.

The ear readings can be very inconsistent according to different factors such as which ear they use and position of the ear and lack of steady contact. I will be using the under the arm when my girl gets home. just wanted to pass the info along.

This is a VERY funny book! And well done. Murphy, like many dogs and their humans had gotten into the habit of too many calories and too little exercise. To view the storyline as a case of ""society's...reverence of appearance above all else"" and to equate Cheryl's conduct with ""humilia[ion] by forced exercise or dieting"" is a major case of the reader projecting HER issues on Murphy! He's a dog: he lives to eat, sleep AND please his alpha dog, Cheryl. And Cheryl, like any good alpha dog (or parent, for that matter) is using positive discipline and proactive behavior to mold her protege into the best--and healthiest--dog he can be.My kids love this book!

Then I went shopping for a new bulb and realized this is where the 150w hps wins hands down. The Feliz 125 CFL (6500k) I found was $40 plus shipping while a new Ultrasun 150 is $15 plus shipping. So for more than twice the price you get half the light. If you're worried about vegging in the red spectrum, don't be. The lumens per watt and cost savings on bulbs more than make up for it."

The precious few insights he offered into the real workings of some wonderful kitchens were interesting, but he wound up the telling of every part of his professional life (except his time with Ducasse) by telling us that while that particular chef and his staff obviously meant well, they did not have the true commitment to preparing and presenting great food like Psaltis himself did. (His favorite backhanded compliment went something like, While that may be fine for some kitchens, it wasn't up to my standards.)By the end of the book, I had grown weary of Psaltis's snobbish take that no one else could live up to his standards.

But little has been said about the changes done to the Crawfords. The movie makes them both out to be a plotting devious pair, far beyond anything that could be passed off as being Fanny's view of them.The movie is definitely not Mansfield Park as written by Jane Austen. But it is still entertaining, so long as you are prepared for the excessive devations from Austen."
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Almost too real This movie finds Ernest as a ball retriever at a driving range with aspirations of driving army trucks like real army people. His buddy assures him that if he joins the reserves, he can party every weekend while driving the big green trucks. So Ernest joins up. But coincidentally, his unit suddenly gets called up and sent to the Persian Gulf as peace keepers monitoring a border dispute. The border dispute goes rapidly out of control, and Ernest winds up on the front lines. The fate of the civilized world is in his hands!Given the theme, it's not surprising that this movie is a bit more violent than Ernest's standard kids' fare. Guns actually get fired (but not by Ernest) and people fall down. If you are familiar with the Middle East or the army, you will find lots to laugh at in this movie. However, the overall plot almost comes across as too real these days to be as preposterous as it was originally intended."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Very Good Sound, except....(now fixed). This adaptor puts out clear sound with much more detail than another similar adaptor that I already owned. The only problem is that it frequently has a ticking noise that repeats every 2 seconds or so. To me it sounds like some kind of static discharge from the turning of the mechanism inside the adaptor. This ticking happens even if I unplug the audio souce from the adaptor. If I focus on the music, I can usually ignore it, but once it catches my attention, it sometimes makes me a little crazy. Aside from this annoying problem, it is a well constructed product with otherwise excellent sound.UPDATE: I sprayed some WD-40 in the adaptor and it cleared up the ticking noise. I still think it was a static discharge problem and now the added WD-40 keeps it from building up a charge. 5-stars rating now that the ticking is gone."

I was excited to read ""Cross,"" as I had read two of James Patterson's earlier works, and enjoyed them both. However, I was pretty disappointed with this one. While I thought the book was faced-paced and the plot moved quickly with all the action (murder, rape, murder, rape, murder, rape, etc.), I found the writing quite bad and even laughable at times.I also felt there were a number of details that were never explained, such as where his youngest child came from? Perhaps I would know that from reading his other works, although if one were to pick up this book as I did without knowing the main character, such details should not be overlooked.Overall, even though I did enjoy certain aspects of this book, I have a hard time recommending it.

While the central conflict was eventually revealed, the various tangents the narration wandered off on became too distracting to really enjoy the central core of the story. Perhaps the biggest disappointment of all was the ending.

(And barely at that.) It is as if someone had grabbed scenes from a bunch of different films at random and filmed them. (Which may actually be true, from what I have read about the film.)Jackie Chan is in the beginning and end of the film.

I had a high expectation for the FM transmitter.What I didn't like: 1)RF power (transmitter has to be pretty close to the receptor - radio); 2) The sounds come with too much Bass; 3) Low life for the batteriesWhat I do like: 1) an option to use the power cord while you are using into the car

I am a beginner pastelists. This book covers a lot of material on pastels, from paper selection to pastel types, etc. The examples are not as useful for me at this point, but would probably be of more use to an advanced artist. Yet the book is still good for beginners also because it covers several different topics and techniques on pastels."
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Disappointed I must have clicked on the wrong book of the several I was reviewing. This is not the book I wanted. It has no information about the basics of kitchen layout and design. It consists primarily of pictures that are of limited usefulness for selecting a look (many of the pictures appear to be very dated) nor are they helpful in choosing the size and shape of a kitchen. In fact, the pictures are of poor quality. My advice -- don't waste your money on this book. It is not helpful in any way. We recycled it....."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Too much canned soup in this book There are several great recipes in this book. The disappointing aspect of the book is that many of the recipes rely on already prepard/processed foods (i.e. canned cream soup, etc...) True, the recipes call for the 'lower-sodium' version of the soups, but, to try and be healthy, eating all the chemical crud that's in these soups seems like a dumb idea. So, while there are many recipes that I'll make (modifying the recipes to use non-prepared/processed foods), I probably won't buy any more of the AHA cookbooks."

I'm dumbfounded knowing he killed himself! All this time, his remarkable story sustained me through my own struggles. He is a loser after all! How awful.

The subject fascinates me. Unfortunately, I got the sense that Rodriguez, brilliant as he may be, has the attention span of a sparrow. He interrupts himself in mid-thought, flitting from one half-expressed idea to another and then falling back on a personal anecdote. Invariably, just as I thought he was about to get into some interesting territory he would fade off, seemingly forgetting his place. Frustrating - I'd love to read a similar book written by someone more coherent."

Ben Gibbard, the lead singer and songwriter for Deathcab for Cutie, teams up with several other indie rock stars here to produce a wonderful album. Give Up sounds like Deathcab only in the sense that Gibbards voice is still the same soulful light that it is with his other band. The lyrical content is definitely a lot more upbeat than transatlantism. The Electronic sound of the album can sometimes be distracting, but at the same time it lends the album a steady beat that helps a person escape to Gibbards peaceful world if just for a little while.The lead singer from Rilo Kiley can also be heard singing backing vocals and was a pleasant surprise when I heard her. While the Postal Service may sound kinda like Deathcab they are definitely their own band and I would recommend Give Up to anyone who liked Deathcab or who likes softer indie rock."

Kundera's worst aspects are all on ample display here: his clumsy, if not indifferent, depictions of women; the valorization of the sexual conquest (coupled with degradation here); and his philosophical and historical musings. At his best, Kundera makes these weaknesses into a plus. (Don't ask me how but they work.) Here, these qualities are all parts of a carnival of pathos.It is as if Kundera decided to write the appendix to 'Immortality.' But this time around the structure isn't so surprising.

Also, this cd really needs a remastering job- the sound is fuzzy, grainy and distorted- making this album sound older than it could. Dio has made some great heavy rock over the years- his powerful metal voice, stick it to 'em attitude and fantastical lyrics have made him many fans.

I used it as an all-purpose moisturizer - yes on my hands, but also on my face. It was amazing. It made the skin so soft, and really did seem to make a difference with the fine lines. I now use it every night on both my hands and my face. I love it! And so much cheaper (and more effective) than some of the $100+ face creams out there that I have tried. Others have posted reviews saying how much they like the smell. I am not so keen on it. My son asked me the other night why I was putting play dough on my face.

I have in my collection the original LP box set of the opera which is split into four complete acts. Hummm.Nevertheless, I my mind it still remains the opera by which others can be measured. As one other reviewer observed Fritz Reiner is, with out a doubt, one of the finest conductors of his day along with Sir George Solti, Otto Klemperer and others.For those wishing to further enhance their operatic collection they may wish to consider obtaining copies of ""The Marriage of Figaro"" and, of course, ""La bohème"".

This shaper really worked hard and helped move and shift parts very well. Sure, it's super tight, but has a bunch of tummy support. Also, the bust cups didn't flatten me, but actually gave me shape and stayed up well. There is a snap crotch which I didn't realize, what a blessing. I have larger thighs so I knew it would be really tight at my bikini line, but it's tollerable considering it could have been a lot worse. Overall, great item for the price!

The book merrily takes for granted the truth of various New Age claims, most deeply, the existence of the soul. Meanwhile, in the centuries since Descarte's ill-fated dualism, science has understood that the mind exists as the computations of the brain, not as some sort of magical soul-essence.Why waste your time here? Zukov tries hard to paint a cheery picture of a comfortable world where humans are special, but does it at the expense of the rationality that distinguishes us. For a better understanding of what you are, try Steven Pinker's ""How The Mind Works"" or Daniel Dennett's ""Consciousness Explained""."

This camera is nice in the fact that the child only has to push one button, aim, and shoot- but the BEST resolution, which is AWFUL only allows about 20 pictures to be stored on the camera before a download.

I love B movies, and I knew what I was going into with buying this because I have watched most of Brain Damage Films (most of which are awful).

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Not shakespear but fun If you go into this movie expecting sublime plots or whatever, then you're doomed to dissapointment, if you go in, just expecting a fun movie, then it can be a lot of fun. It is in no way, other than a few homages, tied to the original TV series, so don't go expecting it to be a continuation. It's not. It's a stand-alone story, and, as such, stands alone. It's typical summer scifi action movie fare, and for the day, the CGI was really good. Now it's dated, and suffers in comparison, but CGI always does that. Overall, a fun movie. Interestingly enough, this version had a lot about french subtitles and features, so I am guessing this is the french export version, no problems, just thought I would put that out there."

She spent several years working in groups around london, both 'high magic' and wtchcraft groups. Unlike some earlier studies of this sort, Greenwood does not attempt to 'explain away' the results of her training. Instead she uses a more modern anthropological approach that recognizes the validity of the experiences magicians have of the 'otherworld' and attempts to find its meaning.Very interesting for magicians and scholars alike."

This was Maidens first record together with Steve Harris, Dave Murray, ""H"" Smith, Nicko McBrain and the legendary Bruce Dickinson on vocals. This is a MUST HAVE if you call yourself a Maiden fan. GO OUT AND GET IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT!! It is a sonic, ear shattering, mind numbing assault on the psyche and you will be better of because of it. UP THE IRONS IN '99!"

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Somewhat stale, though excellently performed material While I was really disapointed with the previous DT cd ('Falling Into Infinity'), at least it was an attempt by the band to try something new. Here, we get basically re-hashed riffs seemingly leftover from the first two albums. I was looking forward to this release because I thought that Jordan Rudess could provide a fresh, positive, profound influence on their sound. Boy was I wrong ! His talent is pretty much wasted and relegated to a minor supporting role. And why does James LaBrie sound so self-concious ? Seems like he's trying to sing like a non-trained singer (where did that passionate, resonant vibrato dissapear to ?). Seems that DT might never be able to duplicate 'Images And Words' and 'Awake', so why even try ? Let's see if these guys can mature as a band and not get stuck repeating themselves like so many other bands in this genre. DT were true innovators in the early 90's, now let's see them live up to those expectations !"

As I read this book, it felt as if Alfie Kohn had been inhabiting the recesses of my mind that were (to me) inexplicably torn about giving our daughter a treat when she used the potty. Whether you read Alfie Kohn, Magda Gerber, William Sears, or many others, respect for children remains key.As a Children's Librarian, I see many flavors of parenting every day. I also see the effects of parenting styles on unattended children on a daily basis. What helps me remain a caring professional even on rough days is respecting the young customers who need assistance. I've seen enough child reactions to silently hope for better from my own daughter, but this book has encouraged me to think about what I really want for her, why I want it, and how to allow her to become the best person she can be."

It gets in the ballpark, but never really made me go ""wow"" for any extended period of time. Plus you're paying quite a bit of money for only one disc of music.

As much as you'd like to buy this game, it's not worth it unless you think it'd be great for your child to start off slow.

I must say that this is one of the biggest waste of money I have ever spent. It almost puts me to sleep...almost all of the songs are mono tone and dull. There are no songs that stick out as being ""classic"" like the older stuff Janet is know for. This CD will most likely fall like a rock on the charts. The first single ""Just a Little While"" peaked at #45 then quickly fell and the second single ""I want you"" Is doing much worse and is currently charting in the 60's.

Bad product. You need to manually uninstall previous versions, otherwise God help you. 1 year expiration is so well enforced that it can cause your O/S to go bad, I had to reinstall my Win2K. And updates to McAfee products are more frequent than even Microsoft. And if you have a dialup, don't even think McAfee, imagine downloading 10-13M files every 15 days. And DAT files are updated in bunches of 30-40. Firewall is so good that even if you ask it to remember some program to allow, it still asks you, very loyal firewall really. And try updating all components at the same time, and watch the fun of rebooting.Even if you can live with all this, their REBATE is BOGUS. Either McAfee cheats or Amazon is lying re the rebate. I sent the older version CD as proof of upgrade, and I sent the only UPC on my box. It seems that is still not enough. McAfee seems to have an old habit of rejecting rebates."

How much authority do corporations, or organizations, have over humanity? Should our rights, whatever they may be, be sublimated for the ""improvement"" of the species, or our collective circumstances?The book definitely raises some interesting points, however the story is a bit too overdramatic at times, and unrealistic at others. The love story would definitely be an example of the latter - where the main character is willing to travel through centuries of time to test a ""love at first site.""I enjoyed the book and the questions it raised, but I would not go so far as to say it was exceptional. It is worth the read."

I ended up taking the metal clips off of my factory unit and putting them on the kit unit, after which the kit held much better but still did not sit flush on the right side.

Finally after a lengthy time away from us, the madman has returned with a vengeance. Here he has crafted a deeply moving ( Hold On) and deeply hysterical (Filipino Box Spring Hog) album. Tom swings from power chords to soft crooning like only he can. Let me go no further without mentioning Tom's voice. Frankly it sounds as though he's drinking whiskey that's as old as Damascus and gargling rusty nails in between drinks. The interesting thing is that Tom's voice always manages to capture exactly what he's trying to accomplish. Don't rush out and buy this album because you saw The Heart of Saturday Night or Rain Dogs in your Dad's records. Tom Waits is an acquired taste. The songs have obvious flaws, but that is what makes them so memorable. This one will stand up quite well in Tom's catalogue."

It came in a masquerade. Then it pulled down its mask and showed its fleshless bone.""Nature does not have a volition, viruses simply ""are.""Barry should have trusted inherent drama of the facts and simply told the story.Cut 100 pages of tangents and repetitions and the reader would be left stunned by the events, not reaching for caffeine."

The beginning is quite slow and vague. The cinematography is very dull and most of the movie feels like a stage play inside the same 2-3 rooms. A lot of the story is rather dramatic and contrived about the list of enemies and old flames that arrive. There were several compelling moments, but a lot of it is based around bravado and a bit of chauvinism. Not really memorable lines or scenes. I like Cary Grant... but thumbs down."

I think the intention was that you are able to tilt the controller to help with steering but my kid simply likes to hold the controller flat and only steer with the D-pad. Players should also note that there is a difference between DRIFT and DRAFT in goals.There are a few bugs too. Sometimes the game will freeze or stop playing background music and you have to reset the Wii to play.

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Is the thrill really gone? ""Spend The Night"" is hardly a good album when compared to the stellar work the Isleys did in the 1970s. It is however a reasonably decent (if a bit trite) attepmt at the kind of elegant sould-R&B music the group usaed to make before the Isley-Jasper-Isley split in '84. Angela Winbush's production tends to be a bit sparse and synth-heavy, but the total effect is classy, if a bit dated nowdays. Lyrics are a sore spot, especially on the second half of the album. Overall, unless you really love the stellar title track, or the equally good ""You'll Never Walk Alone,"" you would be better served to buy the Isleys earlier work, an Angela Winbush album (where the same themes are repeated and done much better), or the mid '90s smash ""Mission to Please,"" which marks the real returm of guitar virtuoso Ernie Isley to the mix."

In calling the company I was told by the receptionist that to replace the remote it would cost $45 for a universal remote and $65 for the original remote plus $15 shipping. The remotes do not appear to be of a quality/size that matches that price in my humble opinion. I was told the remotes are never covered in the warrantee. The units come with one remote each.

It's not the fact that every recipe does NOT include a picture. I own more cookbooks than my local library and not all of them have pictures. I just didn't seem to be overly impressed with the recipes in this book. For instance, the lasagna recipe, there's nothing impressive about the contents and I make a far better five cheese lasagna.

This book is full of ramblings that present Wolfe's position that Eric Ambler is not the master of intrigue that he is widely-acknowledged to be but, rather, is a somewhat mediocre aspirant to such status. In my view Wolfe largely misses the most important point of Ambler's books: they are only superficially novels of intrigue. More fundamentally they are expositions on human strength and frailty as well as human behavior, especially under stress. That Ambler is able to explore such matters so skillfully in the guise of highly-entertaining novels of suspense and intrigue is a sign of genius not mediocrity."

Issued postumously, this album contains wonderful power chord rockers as well as sweet melody instrumentals. Don't Look Down, combines Mick at his rocking best with Joe Elliott's vocals to create one of the best straight ahead rockers ever recorded. Other collaberations, including songs with Chrissie Hynde and John Mellancamp show Mick's virsatility. Life's a River, with Mellancamp on vocals, is a great tune that shows just how good Mick's guitar playing was. It has been only since his passing that we've been able to see and more importantly hear this great music and other recently issued material. He is missed."

She is certainly headstrong and tough in the beginning. But after she marries the hero, she becomes this wet noodle. She apologizes for things that HE did wrong and simpers in his presence. Not my idea of a tough American gal.The heroine basically begs for sex from this guy knowing he doesn't love her. She is just the epitome of a woman with no self-respect.The hero is so emotionally detached that it is hard to even like him a little. He finally comes around in the end, but by that time you dislike him so much you don't care anymore.The subplot about the Madame from France was silly, but I guess the story needed some spice.Definitely not my favorite, but I guess it was okay."

The gangs were'nt even believeable and for some reason they dubbed the actors speaking engligh into english if that makes sense. It was just really corney, not even shot in the bronx.

I only read it because I loved ""Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of the Lambs.""Understand, I can't blame Harris for cranking out this dopey sequel. He probably did all right financially with the previous two, but with Hannibal Lector now nearly an institution, there's big, big money for him in the sequels.

Granted, I had not yet nailed in the cardboard-like backing provided, but the thing had several inches of movement when I would rock it side to side.I felt that the stability the may be provided by nailing in the provided backing would not be enough to make me feel comfortable, so I went to Lowes and bought a 1/4"" thick wood sheet which I cut to fit the back, painted it white and screwed it in.

In fact, the caterpillar does not eat through one slice of salami, he eats through the entire salami (the slices remain uneaten).I am dumbfounded how hundreds of people can rate this book so highly with this gleaming error. I guess it shows how poorly we have become at reading comprehension. Even after 40 years, the author has made no effort to fix it. Therefore I am forced to rate this book no higher than 2 stars.

Concerning the songs, I particularly love Judith, Rose, The Hollow and Orestes, maybe because they are the most representative of the atmosphere of the album.Now the bad side: the ""hard"" songs. Why did they made songs such as Sleeping Beauty and Thinking of you? I mean, they could have been good songs, but they just interfere with the rest of the album, disturbing the atmosphere. I just skip these songs when I listen to Mer de Noms.Well, anyway, it's really a great album. I'd give 4.5 stars, but I can't, so just trust me.

I was really shocked and disappointed at how bad this last book was, considering how good the rest were. I was looking forward to rereading this series many times in the future, now it will go to the thrift shop."

If you grew up with the Allman Brothers recordings from the Fillmore East you may be disappointed. It's good music, and it contains some tracks you may not have heard, but it suffers in comparison. If you like The Allman Brothers this is a must buy. Just be prepared for some not so subtle differences in the songs you know so well.Yes, I know I'm being picky, but that was my impression of the product. The quality is good, the mix is as good as you're going to get live, and the song sequence makes sense. Overall it's enjoyable, and for me it's great road music, especially Mountain Jam."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","My opinion...of the book and of some reviewers It's a rather informative book in all. I must say, however, that some of the people who bash the book are not very literate (putting it kindly) and are more than likely Masons themselves. They must know that the more they trash a book like this, the more anxious it makes people to own a copy. (See the circulation of the National Enquirer.) I'm happy I bought this book. I think if the Masons weren't SO caught up in being hush-hush, the thrill of uncovering secrets would disappear. And why would they hide things if they did everything on the up-and-up and were so upstanding? Makes me believe every word in this book."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Disappointed This installment bears no resemblance to Galsworthy's novel. The casting of major characters is abysmal--the actors playing Irene and Jolyon in particular appear much too young even with aging makeup. Jolyon is supposed to be twelve years older than Irene and in his seventies when he dies. The actor in this adaptation looks barely forty-five. Gina McKee is totally miscast as Irene. Irene in the novel is elegant, reserved, mysterious--an incredible beauty with regal posture, dark gold hair, and deep brown eyes. McKee is thin, coltish, stoop-shouldered with prominent teeth and squinty blue eyes. It is impossible to associate her in any way with Galsworthy's Irene. The old BBC production is much more faithful. If you've read the book, this new version will be a major disappointment."

Thank you Steve King and Max Armstrong of WGN 720am radio in Chicago for turning me on to Big Bill Doggett. At roughly 4:53am in the morning Max comes on to do the farm report, and if the karma is right, Steve will play ""Honky Tonk"" (part 1).With the first notes of the guitar, Max will start drolling, and reminiscing about his youth back in Indiana when the carnivals or fairs would come to his town. Back then every carnival would have that special tent where inside ladies would disrobe, what we would call a ""tease show"" today. ""Honky Tonk"" would be one of those songs playing in the background. Doggett's music is what I would call ""grunt & grind"", perfect mood music (no singing) all instrumentials. If this CD doesn't take you back to the early, early 1950's, nothing will. Thanks again Steve & Max."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Painfully hard to watch Have to admit, I was really looking forward to seeing this film because I thought the premise was completely original. About 10 minutes into it, I began to get frustrated with how amateurish the writing and the acting was. It went downhill from there and fast. There are a couple of moments that begin to mine the potential the film has, namely every moment Malcolm McDowell is testifying on the stand as Satan. Outside of that, every time you see the defense attorney characters on screen and every second of the legal talk show in the film, you'll think you're watching a Mystery Science Theater episode, that degree of campy art. Great concept, some memorable moments, McDowell is fun to watch, poor execution overall."

In fact much of the book can be found in the other Avedon book ""An Autiobography."" Overall I found the book to be boring and not up to the par that Richard Avedon is know for.

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Disappointing After seeing Joy Fielding books on store shelves for a long time, I finally bought one, but if Mad River Road is typical of her stories, I won't be buying any more.The one thing she has going is the suspense. Yes, the story is plenty suspenseful, enough foreboding of future events to keep the pages turning. But the problem is, I don't LIKE any of the characters. The women make lifelong bad decisions and then we're supposed to think of them as victims? We're supposed to worry for them? Jamie, in particular, verges on criminally stupid. Emma is irresponsible, Lily is better but none of them provoke my concern, none really make me cheer them on. I truly do not understand why this is a bestseller. I'm guessing it's riding on the coattails of some of Joy Fielding's earlier books. Which I probably won't read."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Good CD of German music. This CD, ""Alles Nur ein Spiel"" (All Only One Play), does not strike me as her best German album. However, I love the type of music on this CD. Thus, I approach a review of this CD with mixed emotions. I like the music very much, but I do not think others will share my opinion. On to the details. There are twelve songs on this CD, and not as much variety as in most Mireille Mathieu CDs, as this is almost entirely love songs with similar music types. Despite this criticism, the music greatly appeals to me personally. I particularly liked: ""Wie soll ich leben ohne dich"" (As I am to Live Without You); ""Paris""; ""Das echo der verlorenen zeit"" (The Echo of a Lost Time); ""Immer frei sein"" (Always Freely Given); ""Niemal ohne dich"" (Never without You); and, ""Liebe stirbt nie"" (Love Never Dies). A good, but not great, Mireille Mathieu German CD, but right down my alley."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Unintentionally hilarious This is a hokey, dated, low-budget quasi-drama which crumbles despite a potentially interesting premise: a possibly rabid man ties himself to a post. Unfortunately, high jinx ensue, and whatever drama could have existed is obscured by child anti-star Gus' stereotypically bad acting and shaggy (anti)haircut. My favorite scenes are when Gus brings blankets (for no apparent reason) and gets socked in the kisser. The hallucinatory scene where the guy gets attacked by a Davy Crockett hat takes the cake though. Truly one of the funniest bits ever captured on film. Inconsequential sideplots abound, naturally... and what a conclusion!"
5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A Great Escape by a Great Russian Composer Prokofiev had just escaped from the horrors of World War II (the Soviet government sent him to a refuge far from the war front); he had also just escaped from an unhappy marriage (he brought his new girlfriend with him, and they collaborated on the libretto for ""Betrothal in a Monastery""). The result was a brilliantly witty score filled with lyric melody. As expected, this production with Gergiev and the Kirov Opera is satisfyingly authoritative. The cast is excellent and Netrebko is outstanding. The sets are ingenious, the costumes are beautiful, and the commedia dell' arte ballet sequences are gorgeous. Audio quality is loud and clear. I am certain that you will enjoy this 20th-century comic masterpiece, this performance, and this DVD."

How short is that? just take a look with the watch photo i uploaded. (the 3 hands are just about total thickness of 1mm ...) So, if you want to have decent depth of field, you need to narrow it down to about F11 or even smaller. You will need a tripod in this case...

I've liked most of her CD's, but as a result of this recording am beginning to doubt her interpretation of many of these pieces. Like many other reviewers I am not an expert by any means, but I am thinking that being as young as she is affects her interpretation of the music. Maybe I will change my mind later, and maybe I am just used to hearing Bach a certain way who knows?

The case it came with was pretty useless as it took forever to get them inside of it and when you did, it never closed right. All in all, I was very happy with them until the left side stopped working. I believe one of the wires must have gotten loose since it will work if I hold the cord a certain way, but I shouldn't have to do that.

The crown that's pictured with a Medium size, is not what you're getting. It's the one that comes with Small and Large size. The issue is that the crown flakes and smells toxic. The smell was so strong, that after two minutes, I had to put it back in the plastic bag it came in. The dress had threads and stitches coming out here and there. The detachable sleeves, were barely holding on to the tiny piece of velcro.For the reasons mentioned above, I've sen't it back the same day I got it."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Slow. Plotless. I suppose this movie could probably appeal only to a specific niche. If you see films as art and enjoy dissecting a movie into its separate components, you might like it; otherwise, if you appreciate movies as entertainment/a single piece of work that tells an interesting story, it could be torture.I met the main characters in the beginning and found the film predictable from then on. Apart from the lead, the characters generally have no depth and are just not engaging -- I didn't care for any of them. I felt bad for the leading lady once, maybe twice -- but I got over it quickly. The entire film drags on and on, as -- I found out too late -- there really isn't a story. (No ending, either. And, no, it's not one of those exciting cliff-hangers.) Still, I kept it on because I hate not finishing movies that I've begun watching. It was brutal. I had hoped it was a ""slow burn"" that would give some satisfaction in the end. But, no: It was an absolute waste of my time."

Both are crucial, but performance often makes the difference between a mediocre presentation and an exceptional one. Author Tony Carlson has written a useful book on how to prepare and deliver a speech to achieve maximum impact on your audience. He covers all the details, from manuscript preparation to rehearsal techniques to post-speech follow-up. He writes in a witty, flowing style, and he includes invaluable anecdotes, useful checklists and a section on dealing with speechwriters. While ""wowing"" today's skeptical audiences is no easy task, Carlson's tips will help you get listeners on your side. We recommend this book to professionals who want to sharpen their speaking skills, speechwriters and anyone involved in corporate communication."

This book cleared that up in a matter of minutes. Anyone who has wondered why civilizations have had different paths of development should definitely read this book.

That said, this movie follows in the fine tradition of Hollywood doing a lame imitation of a great foreign film.Where Das Boot strove for claustrophobia, along with a sense of humanity, U-571 delivers a story full of explosions but devoid of accuracy or emotion. In the end, you don't really care who lives or dies.That kind of says it all, except that if you're interested in naval realism, don't expect if from torpedo shots that make miraculous hits, and depth charges that pop every second for, oh, it seems like minutes. And the back of the German ""destroyer"" seemed to look a lot like the low rounded back of a tugboat, which was odd as the destroyer in the combat sequence looked credible."

I use it for my 20 pound gray tabby, and although it took some time for him to get used to it, I think he likes it as well.First of all, the pan on this box is very deep, which helps a lot in keeping my tabby from tracking litter out of the box. To get an idea of how deep it is, the bottom half is the same height as the top half. So make sure you have plenty of vertical space for this box because it will need it.My one complaint is that my tabby, who is incredibly smart, couldn't figure out how to use the hinged door. Plus, the door is constructed pretty cheaply. I removed it and threw it away, but even without the door, the box itself is a pretty good value. The quality isn't the greatest, but it's only $15. It's about what I expected, and as long as it's not moved around a lot, I expect it to work just fine for the long haul."

After a month of use I notice some modest improvement, the ultra light expression lines are almost invisible but the medium ones are still visible but slightly less pronounced, I didn't take before and after pictures of myself so this is based purely on memory.

One of the most fun and entertaining challenges of this game was trying to figure out where the players start, which is not indicated on the board or in the instructions. The game is especially fun for four players, as the instructions state that players may not occupy the same space, and must therefore stack up behind one another in a delightful log-jam configuration.

I'm constantly trying to keep it from banging into walls and getting it unstuck from furniture corners. The wand also spins and trys to kink. Since I don't use the stow away feature there is no place to hook the wand. Other than that the vacuum power is great.

Some of the scenes could have been tied together better, it seemed like some scenes were inserted at the wrong time. The special effects, especially the bat sequences could have been better. It's worth watching in any event."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Lots of info, little applicability I love the head first series but IMO this is the worst of them. But that's not bad, this one is still great. The problem with this book is it gives you soooooo much info before it lets you apply it.Here's a real book example: There are like 3 chapters that talk about Entity Beans. But it doesn't explain how to build the deployment descriptor until chapter 3! How much are you going to be able to remember if every page has 2-3 concepts on it and you can't use any of them until you've read ~100 pages?That being said, is there a better book out there to help you start learning EJBs? I highly doubt it. What i'm saying is this book is great, but it could be better."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Adequate, not great We purchased this for use while skiing. Before the case, we put our portable radios in a pocket. This meant that when someone called, you had to stop, pull out the radio and try to communicate. Having the radio on your arm is better, because it's more accessible. However, the solution has its problems. The arm band holds the radio, but it twists around on the strap and around your arm, so that, while engaged in vigorous activity, it's not staying still. It's better than grabbing it from a pocket, though."

The whole concept is astoundingly shot where you start to think about what ifs... some scenes make you want to puke, others pull on your heart strings it is a fantastic series and with actors that fit the comic to the point its creepy. I bought this after I found I liked it, and worried that it might not be worth it, I found it totally is. Granted the first season is only 6 episodes but there is so much bonus footage I don't feel ripped off at all. Great deal, and the spammer who said the section where they chop the guy up, isn't there, it absolutely is, so he or she got a defective purchase, or is just being a noob. Though I would go with the second, I have never once regretted a buy on Amazon. Buy it, it is a steal!"

It doesn't turn on while you are holding the button, and off when you release it, but instead it flashes a few times and turns back off, while making a ghastly noise. I am not pleased with this at all.I'm hoping I can open the wand up, cut the wires to the speaker, and replace the red LED for a white one.I should have just built one myself to begin with."

The author does a wonderful job in both books of explaining concepts and giving practical examples to illustrate the concepts. There is a good chance you will walk away from this book with a brand new perspective on certain accepted policies and ideas. Dr. Sowell is especially adept at making the point that politicians and much of the public live in the world of short term thinking, while economics forces you to think beyond stage one."

The authors explain how to use technology to streamline our practices, stop drowning in paper, and how to outsource much or all the work currently being done by employees to contractors that work offsite.If I implement all the ideas put forth by the authors, I could save many of thousands of dollars each month and increase my bottom line by the same amount.I highly recommend this book for all practice owners that are interested in reducing their overhead AND increasing client satisfaction and retention."

The movie was not true to the book and while this happens a lot in movies (see Enemy at the Gates, nee War of the Rats)in this case it did not improve the story at all and in fact reduced the real story line so much that it was relegated to a delivery device for Bruce's glares and command prescence."

When I heard that they came out with a DVD on American Idol, I assumed that it would be the ENTIRE SEASON. I was mistaken! Out of the 10 top finalists, you only get to view 5 out of the 10 do at least one solo performance. Kelly and Justin do 3-4, Niki does 2, Tamyra does one, and Christina Richin does 1. The DVD did a lot of recaps and behind the scenes, but still it wasn't enough to be worth while.

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A True Review, Not an Exposition The purpose of a review is not to blurt the story and ruin it for the postential reader, but rather to interest, persuade and guide such a reader. Here is mine:The first book was obviously a smashing success. This second book presents some interesting issues. The descent of Nathaniel into the ambitious and corrupting world of wizardry is extremely interesting, and Bartimaeus himself is always entertaining. However, I found Kitty to be a drag. She is an interesting side character, yet I found her to be dense and sometimes strangely unnecessary to the overall story. I think this sequel is meant to lead into a much darker third book, perhaps where Nathaniel is one of the ""bad guys"" and Kitty would take the role of the normal, human overthrowers of the magical government. It'd be interesting to see how the author handles future skeins and storylines. Overall, I recommend the reader go back to the first, and then read this second."

Turning the page, one learns that a Margarita can, in fact, be made with a different Tequila and orange liqueur altogether! Each and every recipe is exactly the same; only the brands of Tequila and liqueur are changed, to protect the innocent.

With all that silence, I had plenty of time to watch the instructor and think, ""That sword must be at least two sizes too big for her,"" and wonder why her eyes never focused on anything.

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Deliberately Restrained At first listen, this 1985 release by Eberhard Weber comes off as slightly dull, plodding slowly along through seven self-titled tracks. Clocking in at just over forty minutes, the music on this CD is so languid it could easily be mistaken for being sleepy. A better term for the songs, however, might be deliberately restrained.Regardless of its title, ""Chorus"" is far more focused on the flashy spotlight solos associated with traditional jazz than the atmospheric ambient jazz soundscapes so often identified with the ECM label. Perhaps this is why many Weber fans are quick to dismiss this release as lackluster.Yet, I find ""Chorus"" to be an engaging and unique entry in the Weber catalog. Currently out of print, I can think of no other album recorded by Eberhard Weber (and I have most of them) quite like this one. It's not my favorite, but it is different. And in that sense it's interesting.I give it three and a half stars. Recommended."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Okay... Everyone's giving this album harsh reviews, and while I agree that the album needs some classics, the songs on it weren't that bad. Now here's an unwritten rule: ""don't f*ck with classics because you can't make them better"". Diddy broke that rule when he did ""Victory 2004"". While it's a good listen, the addition of 50 Cent and Lloyd Banks to the song was a bad decision. The last I heard, G-Unit was never on Bad Boy and had nothin to do with its success. The rest of the tracks are good however, despite Diddy's outro. The hidden Mase song is good(""I Ain't No Killer""). The best off Bad Boy, Biggie Smalls, shows up on alot of songs, with no protest. Most of his classics are on here. But where's ""Been Around The World"" and ""Can't Nobody Hold Us Down"". Those songs are classics, yet they're not included. I was glad that Mase' song ""Feel So Good"" was on here. Before there was Kanye West, Mase was the original cocky rapper. Oh by the way, HE'S BACK.Was this review helpful to you?"

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Poetic, but limited Maybe Mary Renault intended ""The Praise Singer"" to reflect the work of Simonides of Keos--compact, yet expressive and beautiful. Well, ""The Praise Singer"" is beautifully written. It is also too short. On the one hand, I'm grateful she avoided the temptation to have Simonides' fingers in every political pie in pre-democratic Athens; on the other, I wish she'd fleshed the story out more.The book is typical Renault: exquisitely drawn characters (I will never forget her Anakreon) and lyrical language that moves you along (necessary, because there's not much of a plot). But her retelling of the story of Harmodios and Aristogeiton (which feels like a random vignette, unfortunately) is flat compared to the downfall of Polykrates of Samos, which is told second-hand but still gave me chills to read. The book is no epic, and it isn't one of her best historical novels, but if you like Renault's novels on ancient Greece, you will like ""The Praise Singer,"" faults and all."

Oh, those mentalities...Try to recall ""Visitor Q"" and ""Tetsuo: the Iron Man"" if you watched them, then put them together and add a good amount of surrealism aside from ""Tetsuo"". And you'll get ""Organ"". Or maybe you have to do something more because it's by far more complicated than that. Speaking of ""Tetsuo"" - Kei Fujiwara, the director and actress in ""Organ"" had a part in that movie.Well I don't know what to say maybe I'll have to watch it for the second time so everything becomes clear. Although I doubt it will. And for gore-hounds I can say ""Organ"" is pretty abominable at times, gruesome and morbid. Lots of blood, pus and other excretion. Not for the squeamish obviously."

It does work well for blow drying is it is quite effective at pulling hair tight and allowing for style control while still being gentle enough not to pull your hair out. This brush has made my hair very very prone to static problems, but in its defense I have only used it in the New England winter and this may be less of a problem in humid environments. This brush is probably a decent choice if you aim to volumize your hair while you blow dry it. Since I have 22 inch thick hair I dont need extra volume and it leaves my hair looking a bit too big."

The album has a couple of dull tracks, but is for the most part consistently excellent.One thing I'd like to see is Womack writing more of her songs.

Alternately soaring and rumbling, sometimes silly, occasionally sinister. Fersen blends styles from around the spectrum into a fun stew. There is a bit of Tom Waits in here, some gypsy, some Bal Musette, some jazz, some tango. Some highlights: Bucephal - a drunken carnival that lurches along on high-octane accordian. Les Papillons -- almost nostalgic vintage French lounge music. Moi Qui Me Croyant un Saint -- cigarette-stained Waitsian yearnings.I understand almost none of the lyrics (it is all in French), but no matter. This album transports you into Fersen's world.

Bela has such an irrepressible *presence* that even his lesser works are worth at least a look. And a depressed sigh. The print used seems to have been run over by a cement truck.

This book was a flawless as the first two except for the end which crushed the book. I have no idea what happened here. The book was full of so much good dialogue, plot intrigue, well written paragraphs but in the last two chapters it was like a totally differant person was writing. It really did ruin the book for me. I don't know how to describe it... Maybe the most fantastic meal you've ever seen laying before you only to find that it's been attacked by flies and now it's crawling with maggots.I give this book 3 out of 5 stars. Damn you Austen Andrews! What were you thinking?"

On all three times I used it for this purpose, I could not flip the pancakes. The pan is way too slick and the half cooked pancakes slide right off the pan onto the stove. One time it slid and stuck onto the backspash of the stove. Now what are you supposed to do with that? The real problem is there is nothing on the sides to stop the food from sliding right off the pan. It needs a taller ledge/backspash to keep your food in the pan."

This remote simply uses lighted buttons under a semi-opaque overlay and displays whatever functions are available for the selected device. I found that this really wasn't useful at all. In fact, the lack of tactile feedback from the smooth ""screen"" made the remote hard to use. I quickly retired it for my old remotes that I can find the buttons on without looking.That said, it wasn't nearing as hard to program as the other reviews made it out to be, although I wouldn't suggest this for someone who isn't at least slightly tech-savvy."

Arrow shirts of this size fit me great. These Traveler shirts, however, did not fit me very well at all. The wrists are pleated and look very baggy unless you have stocky arms.I have only worn them each once, so I haven't developed any of the other problems listed here, but I probably won't wear them enough for them to fade or have the collars wear out.If your arms and chest are large enough for it to fit (do other same-size shirts seem too small?), these might be good for you.

The pages are very flimsy and would not last long if we used it often. I don't like to tell her ""no"" when reading, so we just don't get it out much. If they could figure out how to make a board book for this it would be awesome. I think we'll use it around 2 or so when she can understand more about taking care of things.

Seemed like they were too difficult for the kids to ""pump"". For the $30 each they cost, I bought two Shakespeare Spincasting combos that came with hooks, lures, etc. My kids caught a dozen or more Sunnies each.

I don't find a standout single, but like most things Finn (Crowded House, Split Enz) their work is best taken in as a whole album. Crowded House fans will appreciate the album."

Taylor has done a great job of modernized the text without dumbing it down. There's a great historical introduction, a bunch of endnotes, and More Fruits of Solitude which the Applewood version does not include. For my money, the Taylor version is the better choice."

Don't expect it to do miracles, but especially when you have a network with several computers or you are using several applications at the same time (e.g. VoIP, gaming and file transfers), it will make things run a lot more smoothly than before."

It avoided most references to the larger picture or to the overall stratagy and focused on the fighting at a company level. As for the critisism that it demonized the German soldier I do not agree. Instead I felt it pointed out how war dehumanizes all who become involved. American troops shooting Germans who had surrendered, while Tom Hanks character looks away or letting them burn does not hold well with a John Wayne image. The German soldiers who fought in Normandy were a mix bag of aggressive elit troops and scared conscripts just like their Americian counterparts, and I felt this was brought foward in this movie. The weopons and attention to detail added to the realism as did the slow motion which many vets remember happening to them in the heat of battle.

This is the first time it's been released to the public in the U.S.It's a spy thriller movie that was shot in beautiful Cozumel, Mexico. Pretty good acting, with a veteran like David Naughton (from Werewolf in London fame), a few sex scenes, some hot bodies, some great action scenes, and even a few explosions. The footage isn't knock-out, but it's okay. And the story while it won't win any awards, it will keep the action moving along.If you only collect and watch A class movies, this one probably won't fit your standard. However, if you like the B movies, and are amused by their quirks and cheeky story lines and dialogue, you might check this little movie out."

Bot only does he handle the different languages, but he conveys the mood and tempo of the book while remaining intelligible.In the end, however, I spent much of the book wondering what I was missing.

Yeah, you do get a sense that she's lonely, you do get a sense that he is a has-been still living the life of the rich and famous and you do see his somewhat distant son get it on with his mother-in-law. But might as well read it here as you'll feel no emotion whatsoever finding it out in the movie. The music is the only thing that spares it from being terrible.This movie is ranked right at the bottom of my list along with Van Sant's Last Days. People seem to overrate these pieces of film waste just because they're different. But my God, you can be different and good, entertaining and thought-provoking.DO NOT BUY OR RENT!"

The 55-200 DX VR already comes with a hood, but this is listed as a recommended accessory with lens by Amazon. It won't let the lens operate thru the whole zoom range when installed in storage mode (reversed). This may provide some incidental protection to the zoom mechanism from accidental bumping when not in use. Just a guess.Otherwise works as it should, just not necessary unless you want a scalloped hood. You probably already know all of this if you do.So, hopefully I just saved you some cash."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Was this a draft?? I agree with the general drift here of Cornwell's Hornet's Nest. It pales next to her well-developed Kay Scarpetta novels. The novel has a rough-edged, unfinished quality to it -- not to mention that the plot is all over the place -- and I wonder if her publisher insisted on getting this book to print way before Cornwell was ready. I respect her effort to try something new, but in the future I hope she sticks to her guns and doesn't publish before she is ready. She can do much much better than this, as Cornwell fans are well aware."

Even though his lyrics are a bit on the dark side, there is a certain beauty in them also. The music that the surviving members have added actually enhances the poetry.

I mean, when he's interviewing non-actors on the street, he comes off as a worse actor than any of them! Is that on purpose?"

To those who are interested in Allingham and Campion I would say, read the originals. In summation: a waste of the reader's time and money."

And while I mostly agree with some of the social ranting, this just isn't good literature. It becomes tedious and tiresome and absurd - the run on sentences enough to choke a reader. In the past, I found Mr. Koontz' books to have a clever premise, to be thought provoking, and to have an ""unable to put down"" element. This one I put down quite easily. Actually, Dean Kartoontz seems to be the scary monster that is emerging - too great now for a critical editor that would chop this book in at least half? However ... if you wish to read something that is as tedious as listening in excruciatingly complete detail Grandma's latest surgery and the subsequent ill conceived complications and reverberations and protracted recovery, well, then this might be just the book for you!"

As a first time mother-to-be, when I saw the title of this book, I was so excited that I purchased it without even reading the reviews. Now that I have it in my possesion, I really wish that I would have read them.I appreciate the illustrations that show the progress of a baby's development week-by-week, but the text leaves a lot to be desired. After reading about my baby's progress each week, I was still left with a lot of questions as well as slight paranoia from reading about all that could possibly go wrong with one's pregnancy. A little warning is good, but don't beat me over the head with it.I have found ""What to Expect When You're Expecting to be a much better reference as well as ""The Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy"" by Vicki Iovine.My advice, save your money and only purchase the latter two books that I mentioned."

The bubbles were difficult to pop and way too easy to jump on. All in all, give me the classic on the NES any day over this poorly made modern version."

Ditto for the repeated references to 9/11.E. Lynn is a fine writer and I hope he comes up with some fresh, entertaining material next time. A Love Of My Own fell far short of my expectations."

For instance, I never could accept Brian in the role of lead singer for a band, he just didn't fit this profile at all. And I wanted to feel his music, his singing, but that never happened. We readers should have felt the music as if we were in the audience, or at least off stage.In most of NR's books, the reader truly comes to know the characters, but not so in this one. Brian and the rest were dull, and I really didn't like the way this story unfolded."

For example, the bronchial passage corresponds with Oak, Star & Century. By applying these to the passage you can directly influence the broncial passage.If you then combine superfically corresponding flowers with flowers corresponding to emotinal conditions (Bach's original method), it is possible to come to a full cure; even if previously you had reached a plateau with Bach's original method.Don't miss this one."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Don't bother. I hated the heroine from the very beginning. She was rude, disrespectful, ungrateful, and just too damn lippy. I wanted to put her on a stake and burn her to death. Just to be fair though, she has a few good points too, but MAN! She runs her mouth like there's no tomorrow that it doesn't matter she has good points at all! I especially didn't like the part where she wanted Gabe, the widower, to say something bad about his dead wife, just so she could feel good about herself. That's not respectful at all, but then I doubt she gave a damn about anything except Gabe and herself.With that said, I still love the author. She has some good books out there: Lady Be Good (which is light as fluff but EXTREMELY funny), Ain't She Sweet?, and This Heart Of Mine. Check those out instead."

The repetitive clogging at the bottom makes for a much stronger pot of coffee than I usually prefer. It's also a pain trying to fumble with the filter to get the water to drain out. Tried different grinding and coffee, but get the same results. I didn't have this problem with the equally expensive brown natural paper filters."

Some women seek revenge on their male counterparts who have wronged them. But, how many women would go to the extreme to rid the planet of smooth talking, womanizing players? The Lady Killer did.After his brother is killed, Jasper ""Jaz"" Ballantine has a score to settle with the Lady Killer. Hot on her trail, he and his psychologist ex-wife Dhana soon find that they are working on more than just the case.Filled with romance, a hint of suspense, and psychological thrills, Lady Killer by Gail McFarland kept me turning the pages not only to see if the killer was caught, but also if Jaz and Dhana could reconcile their relationship. It's not really what I would consider a ""mystery"", as the killer is revealed early on. Instead, I'd call it a worthy piece of supsenseful romance in which the characters are likeable and real, and the crime is deviant, yet possible.Reviewed by CandaceK"

After enjoying the first 2 Spider-Man, people have great expectation of the latest story, especially Spider-Man's arch-villain Venom is in it.The problem with Spiderman 3 is the director trying to jam too much into the movie. Too many characters, too little time, and it ends up that non of the characters has enough development into them. Viewers can't not relate to their pain or why they they fight. The end fight is pretty much meaningless after learning the story of Sandman at the end; people would wonder why Sandman even bother to setup the end fight with Spidy at first."

It's a shame that Traveling Riverside Blues and Hey Hey, What Can I Do were left off this album, and included only in the boxed set reissue - it's the only place you can find Hey Hey, What Can I Do, one of my favorite Zeppelin songs, and with Riverside Blues, you have a choice: Shell out $100 to get it, or sit through the crappy BBC Sessions album.

The only thing I dont like is that you cannot adjust the sensitivity. The steering, throttle, and braking is a little touchy. It is difficult to make slight turns.

And it was rich and potentially quite deep as a sci-fi piece. In fact, many of the episode writers were respected sci-fi authors. Then it went off into a silly, lightweight direction in Season 3 (after patriarch character Rick Marshall left the show) and was subsequently canceled. This 90s version, although by the same producers, and although the visual effects are better, is just not up to the same standard. It is much more in the zone of ""kid stuff."" It's just more juvenile, and not in a cool, campy way. There just isn't the same depth or mystery -- nor are the characters as sympathetic. A real sore spot is the ridiculously silly pet dinosaur, Natasha. It would have benefited greatly from dumping Natasha, and instead investing in developing another subplot."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Great band; wish the audio quality was better. I love the Los Lonely Boys; their studio albums leave the listener wanting longer guitar solos and further explorations of the musical themes they create. So, Los Lonely Boys live must be a real treat; unfortunately this album doesn't have the dynamic range I would have expected and I found myself straining to listen to the complexities of the songs.I've heard other live albums done at the Fillmore that were recorded better than this one, so my expectations were pretty high. Might try other Los Lonely Boys titles and come back to this one only if you're trying to have all their titles."

Call libraries in your area. MANY have copies of these baby editions. Borrow one, even if it's not in the language you're interested in, and try it for a day or two.

I read three and really wanted to like them because of the good characters, but the protagonist is just an accident waiting to happen.

The most in-depth portion of the book is self-hypnosis...but even for that, there are plenty more books and CDs available that do a better job. This book is sorely lacking in anything close to telling how to perform hypno. It's a rather long-winded book and is lacking in actual useful scripting or techniques."

The battery door is held on with two tiny metal screws that require a tiny Phillips Head screwdriver -- not the kind of thing you are likely to have -- just lucky my husband had one for his miniature train projects. I bought this because I wanted the nice gong sound but there is clearly a niche for someone who can offer a timer with a good sound for less money.

In one of Céline's first English albums, we hear her burgeoning career crafted by writers of her more recent hit songs like Diane Warren (Love Can Move Mountains, If You Asked Me To, Nothing Broken But My Heart) and David Foster. One interesting song is by Prince, who having discovered Céline's talent had especially wrote it for her. Céline never fails to use every bit of her soul to sing these songs, and millions can attest to her insuperable dedication in singing, singing well. However, expect to hear quite a different voice from how she sings now... She can be a little loud and explosive sometimes in this CD. A well worth CD. Recommended."

There is nothing different from this ball to a tennis ball for rolling on your foot or back, and there is no purpose that the smaller roller or block serve. The large roller would be adequate for anything that you need, even calfs, which is what the smaller roller is designed for.

It is not the type of book I would normally pick up to read for pleasure. However once I got into the book I found it quite interesting. The book takes place before people were civilized like they are now, and is about people who have a completely different way of living. I can actually say I learned about another culture, by reading this book.The story is about an Indian tribe that gets torn apart by white people. But specifically the book tells about a boy names Saxso that, in my opinion, truly becomes a man by the end. He gets separated from his mother and two sisters while escaping, and as the head of the family it is his job to get his family back together. After learning they had been taken by whites, Saxso sets off for a long, difficult journey to rescue them.The Winter People is the type of book that is hard to start, but once you get into it, you'll be glad you kept reading."

I'm the type who reads instructions and all the manuals that come with products I purchase. This came with no instructions. It wasn't difficult to assemble, but the lower base that is inserted into the lower tube was a bit tricky to initially get inserted properly. One then needs to place the guitar on the stand in order to figure out the best height for the long tubular piece that is inserted into the base. Once assembled, the stand seems like it will be a good, inexpensive support for one's guitar. I very much like the piece that locks across the top of the guitar stand in front of the neck--it's an extra bit of safety to prevent the guitar from falling forward out of the stand. This is a hard to beat price for a good stand.I tried going to the maker's website for instructions and Stagg Music site wouldn't load--even after several attempts? Again, figuring out how to assemble it is easy and shouldn't pose a problem for anyone."

A bit loud when typing fast, but acceptable. The driver software provided by Logitech is inexcusably bad. Crashes too often to make use of the configuration utility. If you actually have the patience to finally customize your mouse buttons and keyboard media keys the software confuses, ignores or forgets many of your selections. Forget about having unique actions tasked to each button for different applications either. Logitech's software can't remember what key was assigned to what application.

As the title says, the only possible reason to own this CD is the song ""November Dream"" - In my opinion the best song they ever released and it's utterly amazing, if only anything else on this release were 1/10th as good. I can almost justify an extra star for that song but I decided against it =PIf your going to get an Usherhouse CD get their first release ""Molting"" its much better, but even at that - ""November Dream"" is their only stake to salvation as far as I'm concened.This CD is selling used for 43 CENTS used at the time I'm writing this and thats 42 cents too much if you already have the compilation disc ""Gothik"" (has ""November Dream"" on it, mislabeled as ""November Rain"")."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Heartwarming I had very high expectations for this movie. Perhaps if I had watched it without these expectations I would have liked it more. It is a heartwarming story of a man, a war hero, who goes to school at an advanced age because he wants to learn to read so he can read a letter he received. It is an excellent movie, but a little formulaic. Perhaps that is unavoidable as it is a true story so they can't change things too much. Very good, but not the best movie I have seen this decade. I am glad I saw it, but wish I could have rented instead of purchased it."

Fine. But how exactly will that set you apart from all the other No Doubt/Green Day/Sublime/Blink 182 clones out there? It won't. This CD is nothing the listening audience doesn't already hear every six minutes on modern rock radio. I'll give you points for the clever lyrics, though.

Arrived on time, but when unpacked it has two dents to the top of the rim. Thing is, it's not like you can pop back over to the Wal Mart and swap it when you've bought it online - once you've unpacked it and your kids have seen it you cannot explain to them they have to wait another week or two in the hope we get another one that has fewer dents. So I keep my dented one. I would buy elsewhere next time for this reason - it is a heavy item with less than adequate packaging and so you need to check it before leaving the store."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Weightless Much like a track on the CD, the best way I can describe this collection of songs is Weightless. I cannot understand the glowing reviews of this CD--unless they are written by friends and family of the singer--but every track sounds alike. Each song has the same airy-fairy whispery vocals, set to an astoundingly similar musical accompaniment. When the singer does, indeed, break away from her breathless, whispery vocals (which is not often), she often is off-key or flat in her pitch. That may explain the breathy, soft, whispery quality of her vocals--her best delivery. The tracks are unimaginable in arrangements, altho some of the lyrics are well thought. But on the whole, a disappointment to me, personally, and not at all what I had expected based on glowing reviews. I found the CD to be a bore--maybe something one might play for background music whilst receiving a massage or a facial."

A rambling accounting of about 3 to 4 days in the life of a teenager named Holden Caulfield. Holden is mentally unstable, and a bit distraught over being expelled from another expensive boarding school. There is absolutley no plot. It is exactly like reading the mind of a teenager with no personal motivation, or ambition. Mildly amusing, mildly depressing, rampant profanity.This is the worst book I've read in a long time. Yes, that includes the House of Night series, and the Cirque Du Freak! I was very disappointed. I would recommend this to anybody who likes to slow down at the scene of a vehicle accident for the sake of curiosity. It offers no literary value or edification whatsoever.When I started reading it, I kept expecting it to get better, or make some kind of point.

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","not too bad This recording has its good points, but fast tempos is not one of them. The tempos seem slow and I think faster tempos capture the essence of the work better. I would recommend the Di Stefano - Callas - Gobbi version. Gobbi's voice is much better than Warren's voice, and there is more chemistry between Di Stefano and Callas. Plus, Callas was born to play Tosca. Her voice is just the right blend of emotion and youth. Her Tosca sounds very real. And while Bjoerling undoubtely has a better voice than Di Stefano, Di Stefano sounds more real, less operatic and more like a young revolutionary. Plus his pianissimos in"" E lucevan le stelle"" and ""O dolci mani"" are unequalled by anyone but Pavarotti. I heard Pavarotti live at the Met in March '04 and his pianissimos are absolutely beautiful, but thats about all he has left. The Leinsdorf is good, but the Callas (conductor escapes me) one is better drama, and after all, that is what Tosca needs to be."

The music, cinematography, and Wes Bentley's performance as the boy-next-door are the only redeeming qualities of this movie. If you want a more honest portrayal of a American suburban family in midlife-crisis, rent Robert Redford's ""Ordinary People"" from 1980. ""American Beauty"" is really just American trash."

These pictures do not convey the feelings of the stories. They act as examples of words the reader may be unfamiliar with, but this is not a dictionary! If the publisher thought they were so necessary, they should have been placed at the back in some kind of glossary, or at least chosen taseful photos and arranged them with an eye for layout.Still, I highly recommend this book, and according to the other reviews this translation is superior to the others.

Both deliver beautifully subtle performances of seemingly simple characters but with complex emotional histories. Heath Ledger and Peter Boyle deliver nice supporting roles as the warden's son and father, respectively. Peter Boyle's southern accent wasn't entirely convincing though (I think he's from Philly). Ledger, from Perth, Australia, was actually more believeable to me as a southerner. The film is unsentimental and morally ambiguous, leaving much open for the viewer's interpretation. Nicely photographed by Roberto Schaefer and mesmerizing but not overpowering score. Contains rather graphic sex scene for an R-rated movie.

Gentle humour, and empathy with all characters. Mistry develops his characters and surroundings in great details. I can visualize the 'Khodadad Building' in front of my eyes.I read this book after reading 'A Fine Balance' and was kind of dreading the end because I was expecting it would all end horribly. (Ofcourse, that does not take anything away from that book - a very moving tale). So it was an added bonus when the end was a softer landing."

I'll give this 3 stars just to be kind to Dostoyevsky, an author I love dearly, but The Gambler is by far the least satisfying, least engaging, and least interesting book by him that I have read. The first half of the book is interesting, but the last half of the book seems rushed, awkward, and unrealized. I put the book down feeling a bit dumbfounded, and certainly let down. If you love Dostoyevsky you should probably give it a read at some point, but personally I would not say it is of pressing importance."

A couple tracks are tolerable at best (my reason for giving this 2 Stars instead of 1), but the rest...God, I'm so upset I can't even see straight! Liberi Fatali, one of the best pieces of FF ever, has been destroyed and tainted by this disgrace of a CD. Even if the sound quality on this CD came REMOTELY close to sounding good, the music has no variation to the music in the games. Besides different electric instruments, the music is exatcly the same. I own almost every CD that bears the FF name, and I can tell you that this is BY FAR the worst. Avoid at all cost. FF fans- stay away!! FF Music newcomers- do not take this music as a true representation of FF music. The real stuff is MUCH better."

Not the real thing, but good I actually got this for my wife for her birthday (along with some other, more blingy things) because she misses grilled food when the weather turns bad. We broke it out last night and I tested it with burgers. I agree with one previous reviewer that the cooking times are really long, but I'm assuming that the temperatures given are to avoid smoke and to avoid too much power draw. Anyway, it worked, the burgers cooked fine and it actually marked them fairly nicely. I miss the actual smoky, flame-cooked flavors, but a little more paprika should help with that. She likes it and it will definitely be used again. I followed the instructions to spray with Pam and the cleanup was easy and fast.One warning: Don't put too much water in the drip tray or it becomes challenging to empty without spilling."
5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Audrey Shines as Eliza March 2006 marked the 50th anniversary of the opening on Broadway of Lerner and Loew's My Fair Lady. I was priveleged to see the original starring Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews. Fifty years later we are still humming the songs from this beautiful play. In the mid-1960s Audrey Hepburn brought Eliza Doolittle to the silver screen. I thought no one could replace Julie Andrews as Eliza. I must admit that I was very much mistaken. Despite the fact that it's not Audrey singing, she took to the role of Eliza as if it was especially created for her and gave a magnificent performance. Sadly, Audrey was cheated out of the Oscar for Best Actress in 1965. The My Fair Lady DVD of the movie version is of high quality and is a wonderful way to preserve this classic film. I highly recommend it to everyone of all ages."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Author didn't do her homework Two things I appreciate in a novel are an intriguing plot and beautiful prose. Bel Canto began with the promise of both, but the story fizzled from lack of conflict until the final pages. However, the major complaint I have with this book is that she calls the interpreter a translator. Translators work with documents. Interpreters work with the spoken word. I'm quite surprised that the author didn't research the profession of one of the main characters, and not even the editor caught this glaring error. There could be a gripping tale woven from a situation such as this one, but Bel Canto isn't it."
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Deliciously Entertaining! This book is pure fun! It's a great trip. The only problem I had was that at the beginning of the book I kept trying to follow and understand every little detail...which is difficult (if not impossible!). I read the first few pages over and over again trying to figure out what the heck was going on; it was very confusing. For people who are very detail-oriented and get frustrated easily, this is not the book for you. But, if you allow yourself to get lost in Adam's world you will throughly enjoy The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A reminder that music is supposed to be fun! This was a made-for-TV concert performed in England in 1985. I dare anybody to keep their feet still while watching this.Carl Perkins was celebrating the 30th anniversary of his song ""Blue Suede Shoes"", and was a master showman here. He sang and played with an infectious enthusiasm that visibly inspired his famous guests.Highlights include Perkins, Ringo Starr, and Eric Clapton sharing verses of ""Matchbox"", a blazing guitar solo by Clapton on ""Mean Woman Blues"", a humorous and impressive demontration by Perkins on how to create a fake reverb effect with a picking technique, and a wild and wooly group singalong with all the guest stars.But maybe best of all was Perkins luring George Harrison out of retirement. The show ends with a moving thank-you from Perkins to his friends and the fans. What a concept, acknowledging and thanking the fans!This video is tremendous fun with some rock legends. I recommend it as highly as any music video I've ever seen."
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","One HORRABLE game! This is not what you'd expect from Rare or from the Donkey Kong series. The game has a really basic plot: The bad croc is going to blow up Donkey Kong's island. Everyone, including me, was expecting super graphics from the expansion pack (which you need to play this game). Not true. The graphics are a bit better then the average game, but not as good as they could be. The game is remarkably similar to Banjo-Kazoie (another 1 star game) in that you learn moves as you progress through the game, something I HATE! The characters also speak in mumbles that get annoying. However, probably the worst part is that the game play is boring and it is hardly challenging. I beat the first level fully and almost beat the 2nd through 5th levels in the first week I had it and I haven't touched it since. The only good part is the multi-player mode. So, if you're going to buy an N64 game, look elsewhere."

Plus, I love reading history books about 16th and 17th century science. So I figured: How could I go wrong?Well, the good thing about ""Kepler"" is that it was short. If it had been more than 200 pages, I just wouldn't have made it through. I liked the beginning part of the book, when Kepler meets Tycho for the first time, but after that it went downhill. Simply put: The last half of the book was a snoozer. Nothing much happens. Which is a shame, because Kepler was an extraordinarily interesting historical figure. I was waiting to be riveted, and it just didn't happen.I really tried hard to like this book, but it just didn't do it for me."

These would have been GREAT if they had put the stories in chronological order. It would have been so easy! Maybe the kids don't notice, but the parents who have to listen/watch repeatedly sure do. For example, the James video has several episodes mentioning James' problem with bootlaces before showing the episode with the bootlaces. Another problem with the James video - they had an excerpt of the James song in between episodes but did not play it at the end. Why wouldn't they play the James song on the James video?Overall, very disappointing that they did not put a little more effort into these DVDs (this includes the Gordon video which we also have). What a wasted opportunity!Can you tell I've watched too many Thomas videos???!!!"

I would like to agree with a reviewer 'music fan from USA' and would like to point out 'in general' I am reviewing the remaining Lightfoot cd's with this review on each following cd. Lightfoot had struck such a thunderous stride on Summertime Dream and the ride all the way was just relentless, churning out such rich vivid landscapes, songs like 'Miguel' come to mind... and then there are albums like this. Passionless. Mixed with the hammiest recording fumblings imaginable. Vocals that seem monotone and obsolete, void of any longing. seem cruel? Well, that's how I feel. Sure there were some goodies. Shadows (3.5 stars) for instance was quite good, but even that suffered a tremendously passionless production. From Endless Wire on out Lightfoot has truly lost his way. These remaining cd's need something they never had, nuturing. Folk and music of this type cannot be manufactured on an assembly line and Endless Wire highlights that."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Interesting but inaccurte Although this book provides an interesting introduction for novice to Buddhism, it does not provide an accurate picture to the later development of Buddhism. It appears that the facts are based on some layerman introductory literatures, but there seems to be insufficient research into the topics in depth. At least, in my opinion, not sufficient to provide a non-biased introduction for beginners and layerman. It appears more as a criticism against the later Buddhism than to provide a objective survey of the subject. There are ample literatures that discuss later Buddhism in an entirely different light from the author depicts in his work. I suggest readers should be cautioned that some of his observations are subjective rather than objective and factual."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",Very interesting This book raises a lot of questions can the idolized America of our collective memory survive in the 21st century? Does the need to being stronger in order survive mean that we have to forfeit our national soul in the process? Can we still claim the moral high ground in an era where we have no sense of ourselves anymore? Is the current War a bungled effort on the part of the administration or part of a larger strategy to shut China off from the oil reserves that it needs to grow?Overall-I really can't get a handle on this book there are some liberal elements and some conservative elements but there are many uncomfortable questions raised that an audience may not want to consider but still need to be addressed.

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A little overproduced, but still good 80's hard rock. ""In God We Trust"" was Stryper's third full-length album, and their fourth record overall. Following up a successful platinum-plus effort like ""To Hell With The Devil"" is no easy task, but Michael Sweet & company remained undaunted. IGWT actually sounds rather overproduced, a little too slick, as the band co-produced this album with Michael Lloyd, who had produced many pop records before, but this was his first hard rock/metal record. But then again, a lot of hard rock albums released during the late 1980's were overproduced. Yet this does not make IGWT a bad record at all. Some outstanding songs include the title track (inspired by 1 Timothy 6:6-10), ""Always There for You,"" ""The Writing's on the Wall"" and the two ballads ""I Believe in You"" and ""Lonely."" While IGWT may not be as good as THWTD or ""Soldiers Under Command,"" it is still a very good record in its own right."

For many years musically they just NAILED it, deftly straddling the line between heady, spacey electronics and heavy guitars and jackhammer beats. And their lyrics still had a sense of irony or humour about them, or they were simply inconsequential, a small piece of the larger puzzle. But this one...where to start ? NO hooks. NO subtlety. NO variety. NO sense that it was created for any other purpose than to bash George Bush. As another reviewer here noted, I neither need nor do I want to take political advice or direction from a burned out junkie musician, even if I DID agree with him. Listening to this album is like going to family Christmas dinner and having to listen to that one crazy ranting uncle that no one likes but puts up with anyway. It is THAT tedious."

There were so many moments I'm sure it was daunting to pick them, but when John Mayer wailed his solo with Eric,BB,& Buddy watching then laid his guitar at the feet of Buddy Guy bowed to him and walked off the stage, there was more electricity in the air than the lightning that forced an early end to the show. Wish that one made it.The reality though is after you stand them all side by side for two days, Eric was still the best we heard all weekend.

I wish Amazon had pics, these are not thick like mortising chisels, but seem to be the standard size and shape without the side bevels. I looked around and saw that 3/8 was the most useful chisel size for mortising if you only have one. It didn't take long to flatten the back and change the bevel to 25 deg. Even if you leave it at 30 deg. it still must be honed. The edge has held through chopping the mortises and I have been hammering away with my mallet (I was much more worried about my shop-made mallet than the chisels edge). Although it doubtless doesn't compare with the above brands, IMO its utility for this purpose combined with the price tag merit 5 stars."

But after hearing the points in some of the positive reviews, I now agree that adults are over-thinking this very simple message.

Oats are oats."" Well, one night after reading all the reviews, I decided to give them a try. Only under great duress will I eat ""regular"" oats again-cracked, steel cut, rolled-any of them. Scottish oats are like oat groats that have been cut into smaller, fluffy pieces.I have gotten into the habit of soaking my grains overnight before cooking. No they don't get mushy. They are supposed to be healthier after soaking. All I know for sure is that I don't get hungry as quickly and they cook up quick. Same with the oats. I soak them over night, add a little more water if needed in the morning, turn on the heat and start adding spices (my current favorites are cardamom, cinnamon and a touch of cloves). I have to remember to stir the pan as the oats cook up quick this way. Sometimes I add protein powder (whey) to make it a complete meal."

What could be sneakier than hiding the last screw underneath a sticker, so you're likely to damage the product further when attempting to pry it apart to repair it? What could be more frugal than hideously inadequate plastic parts that give out when your bottle of rotary-blade oil is still virtually full? The P600C is a high-water mark for planned obsolescence, and planned obsolescence is a terrific way to boost profits so long as customers can't remember the name of the folks who ripped them off.

The first half of the book is really good, with beautiful stories, particularly ""The Bath."" However, after ""Kissing in Manhattan,"" it seems like Schickler tries too hard to make a larger point and strays outside of his limits. Kissing in Manhattan was an amazing story, and then to have the behavior explained in the next one sort of took away its mystique, as did the general march towards making Patrick a sympathetic character and insert some standard, cliched action. I think the author has a ton of potential, though--I'll read whatever he does next."

Being privy to private conversations between them and feeling you are a part of what happened is also very seductive, however I just cannot believe that this book is accurate and factual. Private conversations were written about between people who would have absolutely no reason to discuss these conversation with an outside person.

As hero Stone Hopper (Taylor Kitsch - John Carter) and his naval buddies do their duty for country and for Earth against mysterious aliens, the action builds with the technology of both sides providing spectacular effects. The film makers did a decent job of including the human elements of heroism, duty, humanity, and humility, as the characters fight the aliens in bigger and bigger battles. When the battleship Missouri is brought into the conflict, you can't help but feel proud that a few of these awe-inspiring ships still exist. You always know the good guy humans will win, but seeing how is a fun voyage with great special effects, reasonable dialog and characters, and final scenes that make viewers feel the gratitude that all our military heros deserve."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","One of the Easier Nancy Drew Games I'm a big fan of Nancy Drew games, and The Secret of the Old Clock is a bit different from some of others. This is the only Nancy Drew game that takes place in the past- in the 1930s. It's also probably the easiest of the Nancy Drew games I've played. Nancy undertakes to help her orphaned friend Emily, who has inherited her mother's inn, and fallen into a deep state of melancholy. The inn has been experiencing strange accidents, and it's up to Nancy to figure them out. The puzzles in this game were a bit easier than the standard Nancy Drew fare. Also, there weren't as many locations to investigate as some other ND games. In particular, there's very little to do in the inn, and one of the things ND games do so well is to set up spooky, old, searchable houses. That said, the game is still fun, and this is a great ND game to start with, if one is new to the genre."

Their interest was only marginal. But I recently used the book to help me with interviewing my father-in-law. I used a video camera to record the event so that I didn't need to write during the interview (the book is designed as a workbook to be filled out), and worked through the questions in the book. While some of the questions seemed silly at first (what clothing did you wear as a child), they actually helped us to explore some interesting topics (his mother was good at sewing, and made knickers for him!).So, I can heartily recommend this book as a guide to interviewing your ancestors/relatives. Be forewarned: it takes quite a long time to do the interviewing, so don't wait until your relative is on his or her deathbed."

The authors never took the easy way out of a difficult situation, and there was never a time when I thought, ""Oh, come on."" My favorite parts were the sections about the underground church and the characters in that church, but the main character, Amber Robbins, had virtually no faults, making her a bit hard to connect with. However, most of the other characters, especially Mohammed and Rida Faheedi, and Davood and Mrna, were sympathetic characters and very interesting. Overall, By the Sword is a good book. The strongest parts are the plot, the settings, and the scenes with the underground church. Mike Yorkey and Rick Myatt need to write a sequel soon!"

So ... it's tough to extrapolate the pre-implosion data (pre-2004) to 2008 and beyond.The book went to press after the 2006 elections, and the authors do mention the results in the Foreward.

Other favorites are Don't Let it Bring You Down, Downtown Lights and Take Me to the River.

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Classic Propoganda Film October is a re-telling of the events of the Russian revolution. However, it was commissioned as a propoganda piece so that the only ""character"" that stands out is Lenin, who, of course is idolized. There are the populace and soldiers who are on the side of the Bolsheviks but they are basically nameless and faceless as is the other side (mensheviks). However, its not the plot that makes the movie fascinating but the use of montage and imagery, sometimes dizzying. Not quite as good as Battleship Potemkin but still fascinating. Certainly, not as morally disturbing as Triumph of the Will (which it influenced) but still, a film made to support a government sanctioned point of view. However, the crowd shots and the quick cuts from one scene to the next in a rapid but still coherent fashion, resonates through current film and even music videos."

I listened to 9 ONCE and now I skip it. If I make a copy of this for the car I will leave it out. The last song ""Where We Start"" is ok but again it is very laid back but it does have a nice guitar solo. There is some excellent guitar work sprinkled about the whole album.

However, since they spend too much time talking, it's a 3 star movie."

I had re-read the others in preparation, and boy was I disappointed! Diapers and breastfeeding--page after page after page! I enjoyed her writing style--as always, and I like all the characters, so it was nice to visit them again. But, I just don't see the point of this novel. I truly hope the editing improves, or I will have to say good-bye to Diana. I've seen this problem with other authors--at some point the editors just stop doing their job, resting on the laurels of a ""sure bet bestseller"". What a shame!"

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Whoever said introspection is a bad thing? On the surface, these reviews are nearly scathing enough to pronounce an impending doom of this highly original and genuine rock ensemble, especially since they attacked the dreaded ""sophomore slump"" head-on with their best endeavor yet (""Shine A Light""). I see this release as simply more insular and emotive than its predecessors. Whereas ""Shine A Light"" was more daring and eclectic, ""Tournament"" is sprawling and brooding, almost like a story that needs a climatic finale to make the plot worthwhile, but never actually comes to fruition. From a personal level, after being so enamored with their previous efforts, this is a welcome progression. Granted, it's not perfect and the quantity is substantially less, but the music is as triumphant, engaging, and mercurial as ever. Cheers to The Constantines on this fine album."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Great Idea for a Book......BUT I was ready to really get into some serious character development with this one, but I was sadly mistaken. Yes the sex scene between the 30 something woman and 20 something man lived up to what you would expect. But nobody's character was well-defined enough to make me understand the whys behind the relationship. I didn't LIKE any particular character in this book. And at one point I was actually just wishing that the daughter would hurry up and find out so we could move on from the ""made-up"" drama. I thought this was a great idea for a book, but the dialogue, lack of character development and lack of a male/female relationship that you could actually root for just made me quickly read this book and put it in my ""never to be touched again"" category."

So much detail is placed into these pictures that each time you read the book you see something new. For instance, on the title page the conductor is holding a ticket that is really a place for your child to sign their name. It says ""one ticket to be used anytime, issued by Busy Trains. Good for as many rides as you like and it is signed by P. Lippman, Engineer."" Definitely a step above Thomas so check it out."

Marinated chicken breasts. How about shrimp? Yes, it works. Marinate shrimp in olive oil, parsely, breadcrumbs, parmesan, garlic, salt and pepper, toss them on the grill, close it and wait about a minute.It's great for kids, too.

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Early psychological thriller Written at a time when psychology was transitioning from a branch of philosophy to one of empirical science, Henry Harland's novel is one about mind control and the unconscious. Just before they are about to be wed, the fiance of a Jewish musician is found murdered; her husband-to-be is accused of the crime - but can't remember anything about it. After a trial, he is acquitted. Much later, however, he discovers a letter written by his father to him ordering him to avenge the murder of his mother. The girl he was about to marry was the daughter of his mother's murderer - thus he really did kill her. It's a pretty far-fetched idea, and Harland isn't subtle where subtlety is required and thus sensationalizes the story, but the book is still fairly well written. As an early psychological thriller, it's not too bad. (Harland wrote this book using the pseudonym Sidney Luska.)"

The subject of this review is one of the solo albums he recorded in Europe. This is an excellent album showcasing the man at his prime. This ranks among the best of Tyner's solo albums like Echoes of a Friend, Soliloquy, to name but a few. The recording is out of the top drawer, and his performance is phenomenal. I personally like Bluesin' with Bob, Monk's dream and the rest of the tracks that followed. Anyone who like Mccoy Tyner will not be without this CD. Highly recommended."

The book does a whole lot of ""telling"" and very little ""showing."" It is thin on scenes and action and instead offers a litany of summarizations. I only finished the thing because Ungar's life, no matter how it is rendered, captivates.There is very little artful story telling in this book. I am surprised Mcmanus endorsed it.

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","The best 6th! I agree with Jeffrey Lee. This 6th symphony is superb! I have heard that Mravinsky was a tyrant and led the Leningrad orchestra with a firm wand. He was a perfectionist. But regardless of his unyielding demands and bad temper, his achievement to bring this orchestra to the hight he did in this symphony is unmatched by any other. Packed with passion and emotion, he maximizes each and every movement with fervor and despair. This symphony conveys life with all its ups and downs. In the end, you can imagine the nails being driven into a coffin as a statement of the grand finale and terminal end. Though rather depressing, it is a symphony filled with beauty and drama and I have yet to hear anyone come close to bringing it to such sweeping emotion as Mravinsky and the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Sheer Fantasy I bought this book hoping to better understand Taoism and read about a real-life Taoist master. I had high hopes due to all the glowing reviews on this site. However, when I started reading, I quite quickly realized that this was not biography. It is a historical fantasy novel, with flying women warriors and everything. It makes very little pretense at being historical or based on fact, though the main character is apparently named after a real person. Now there's nothing wrong with that genre, and people seem to enjoy it. But it's not what I expected. And as to whether it somehow overcomes its lack of factual truth to reveal deep spiritual truth, well, I certainly hope the portrayal of Taoism as a cult of magic and longevity is inaccurate. It is certainly not worthy of the Taoism I know through reading the Tao Te Ching.So, if you want a historical fantasy novel set in China, you might like this. But if you are interested in Taoism or truth, look elsewhere."

The costumes look as if they had been designed by fourth graders. To top everything off, the orchestra (which appears seriously reduced) is crammed into a mini-temple on the side. A total joke! Purchasing it is a waste of money; watching it is a waste of time. I wondered if any other operas butchered at this so-called festival have been recorded.

I get it....this man has loved one woman so much that he can't love another....unfortunately that doesn't make for an interesting film. Not to mention it is painfully slow and redundant....BORING. I can't even recommend this film for its' visuals. 2046 doesn't compare to the beautiful In The Mood For Love on any level. If you see it it will only take away from your opinion of the first film.

""Howard's New Life"" is unbelievable and mostly wierd, but it has its funny moments when Howard first moves in and sizes up his new home. ""Barney Hosts a Summitt Meeting"" is also unbelievable, but it turns out to be the best of his ""return shows"" since leaving the series. At the end their are four transistion shows with Ken Berry being established as farmer Sam Jones for the new series ""Mayberry RFD"". The incredibly talented performer is miscast in a lame attempt at continuing the adventures of Mayberry, and ends up being dull and uninteresting. Surprisingly, the show was successful and ran for three years before CBS decided to axe all its rural themed shows. Recommended for completists only."

Ellen was one of those classic tomboys who just wants to like her daddy and grandpa. How original is that. She just happens to also live on a ranch where she just acts like the real cowboy. Wow. I'm not saying that Ellen couldn't be that way, but she could of been less one-dimensional (just like many of the other characters in SURVIVAL! and American Diaries, the latter not as much). Her Grandpa gets hurt so she has to think up some crazy plan using all these ranch equipment pieces that people from the nineties could really care less about. The description where she was trying to move her grandpa (about five million chapters long) drove me so crazy I just had to stop. Try reading one of the first American Diaries books, they have more on the character of the person and less historical mumbo jumbo (and don't get me wrong, I love history!)"

Then ""Cocky"" came out and I didn't like where his style was going, then ""Kid Rock"" which is worse in my eyes. But if you like hillbilly rock and twang, I guess you may like this one.

While this is an impressive work, it has many qualities that keep me from recommending it. Others have mentioned the dearth of dates for historical context.

Combine this with his penchant for melodramatic exclamations and it frequently feels like you are on a ""living history"" bus tour with William Shatner as guide: ""Look! There comes Napoleon down the street! Now he will exact his revenge on Paoli. Never again shall they laugh at Bonaparte.

But a wierd thing happened. I found myself looking forward to the chapters dealing with the killer much more than the sequences with Rhyme.

One can almost imagine a dance hall full of couples swining to the tunes of ""Leap Frog"", ""Woodchopper's Ball"", or ""On the Street Where You Live"".Although the solos are kept short and sweet, all are thoughfully and professionally presented.

(Thus making the line: ""Why a woman in New York was writing articles for a newspaper just as if she was a man!"" completely inappropriate for the time period)And it was not rude to refer to having female children.

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Pleasant fluff The Goo Goo Dolls are an engaging band that exhibit better than average musicianship and a high energy level. Their songs are well constructed and melodic on the whole--standard pop stuff. The album is a nice road CD--good background music that moves along without ever really engaging on any emotional level.It's sort of Enya with a bit of an edge--when it's all done you realize it was nice enough but if there was a message, you totally missed it.For those who are looking for the muzak version of the soundtrack for their life, the Goo Goo Dolls represent a good choice. If you like a bit more emotional and philosophical content with your tunes, this probably will disappoint. But it's still a good CD to have around--the sort of thing you can plug in any time and no one's going to object. There are times when that is an attribute to be valued.But it's hard for me to believe anyone can really think of this as ""great music"". It's very pleasant fluff is all."

At that time it was hard bound, and it was a wonderful book where I could record all of my baby's information up to the seventh birthday.NOW this book has been changed to 3-ring binder style. The pages of the one I ordered were punched too high, making them not fit in the 3-ring mechanism, and the pages would not turn properly.The binder itself is soft vinyl - stitched around a stiffener, and the pages catch under the edges of the vinyl inside the binder.The content of the pages is still similar to the old versions, but the problems with the 3-ring binder make it not worth dealing with, in my opinion.It's unfortunate that this book doesn't seem to be available in the hard cover version anymore, and for that reason, I am going to buy my new grandson a different book entirely. I will miss My Baby's First Seven Years....What a shame....."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Circus Life back in time. This book is very amazingly descriptive on how the employees of the carnival survived. It's amazing they did survive, and many didn't. It was a time when redlighting employees meant killing them. It's a story of survival of the fittest with humans and loving animals. It moves ahead in time (sporadically) when the main character is in a nursing home at the age of 93. I really related to this, as my father was in a nursing home for a long time. It's how the main character perceives himself by looking at his hands, as my father did and not looking in the mirror. By losing the ability to walk. A story of a great love that defied all odds. I was slightly disappointed with the end of the story, as it seemed that it suddenly ended with more to find out. I hope the movie portrays the ending in a better way. This story was researched thoroughly."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","--- A bit better than the first, and I liked how it started up exactly where the first book left off. It didn't reintroduce characters, which I like because reintroductions are annoying.But until I reached the last twenty or so pages, I had been wondering when something was going to happen or if the story was just going to drop off into nothingness in preparation for the third installment. Thankfully there is closure right at the end, so keep going even though it seems like nothing is happening.The dramatic parts are still short of exciting. There needs to be more description before, during, and after these events, because at times I was confused at how Stephan would be one place and suddenly another. At other times the action was just too pathetic and I was rolling my eyes instead of craving to read more.So again, decent story, but needs a lot more backbone."

I have used several, and the popcorn is not crisp, but is chewy, not particularly special in flavor, and full of saturated fat because of the coconut oil blend in the pouches.The unit is flimsy, prone to bending, and IMO does not produce popcorn as good as Popsecret Homestyle or Orville's Movie Theater microwave popcorn.Avoid this item!

How the deftones could have done so much with their previous albums and then just dropped this bomb is beyond me.All the tracks are strict B material and have very little to offer in terms of engaging a listener. It just a barrage of menontenous trashing and wailing that is enough to make a fan who has treasured their unique and innovative spin on metal cry.But I will try not to get misty eyed and just say that some may be able to find some enjoyment in its purity of noise, but I find it pure crap.

It does - but it sticks to the things you could do in the Windows API several years ago. IMHO, in 2004 we are way beyond lines, curves, brushes, pens, images and bitmaps.This is another author going through the motions and updating old content."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Cheap and Boring My Dad bought this game as a joke for me last Christmas. Granted, I was 16 at the time, but it was still boring. All one does is circle the board until somebody lands on an autopsy square (there are very few of these). An attempt is made to get out the organ, and if one fails, the alien lets out an annoying, meek scream. If an autopsy square isn't landed on, all one can do is continue circling the board until by chance it is landed on. The battery box is indeed taped to the bottom of the board. When I opened mine, the box fell off and the ""tweezers"" wouldn't shut all the way, making them extremely difficult to use. We were both disappointed, having expected it to be funny and creative. It was not. I would go for the real Operation game, or, if a paranormal theme is in mind, hit up a different version of a similar game. There are a few out there."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","How Long Is This Book Going To Go On? Ethan Mordden has attempted to write an epic novel and, sadly, he is just not up to the task. At 590 pages, it is about 250 pages too long. There are too many characters and too many sad things happen to them; who can keep track of it all (or even stay interested in)? The author has a habit of periodically switching into the first person, which is completely out of context with the flow of the story. Still, some of the main characters are interesting, which is why what happens to them is depressing. If this is to be considered an accurate portrayal of gay life in America from 1949 to 1991, it is a downbeat commentary."

I have used it on Oak veneer ply and melamine sheets and the chip out is very, very minimal and stalling and binding are non existant. I understand that the teflon coated version of this blade is even better. I find that hard to believe as this little blade is simply amazing.

Since Amazon included a 2 day rental until the actual DVD came, I decided to do a couple of segments to dip my big toe in. Alas, this workout became addicting and I managed to work my way through all 5 workouts at once. The good news is that I definitely feel like I've worked out stomach muscles that I haven't seen this side of 2009, the bad news is that I may have to have my husband help me tie my running shoes tomorrow morning because I'm going to be epic amounts of sore.

Lens cap will not stay on and easy to get lost. 8meg smartcard comes with the camera and is a total waste of time. I would recommend no less that 32megs and I bought a 64 and it will hold 84 photos in the HQ mode. The LED viewer on the back of the camera has no cover and can be stratched quite easily.

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","good, but... Plain and simple, a solid set, but I personally feel that Thibaudet is no master interpreter of Ravel. He seems a bit ""willful"" at times, seeming to go for something different rather than appropriate. His staccato in the first bars of the Pavane is shocking to my ears, and makes this stately piece sound rather clumsy and ambling. The same thing happens in the minuet of the Sonatina and also in Le Tombeau's minuet. Other parts are solid and extremely well-played, but I hate his habit of rushing the time on fast phrases and then slowing down again, as if he is impatient. My pick for the best Ravel set would have to be the underrated Anne Queffelec, available on Virgin Classics for a lesser price."

Digimon is a cool animé as it is more likely that it could actually happen (Though it won't) and it's like in Pokemon if you hurt your hurt for two seconds then you fine but in digimon if your hurt you might need some help. (If you've ever seen the episode with the pyramid in it you'll understand.)

There are a bare handful of records that bear repeated listening, that are great from the first note to the last. This is one of them.It's all been said before: genius, classic, visionary, not a single wasted note, etc. Believe it.For vinyl fans, the Rhino reissue, remastered from the original analog tapes, is very, very nice. I went through several copies of the original, and as sometimes happened back then, none of them sounded so hot. This one is what the original should have sounded like, I think.Make sure you get the Rhino release; there is another reissue out there that was probably mastered from a digital source."

It's true that it will get bogged down if you want a thick shake, but the regular shakes I make mix the powder in BEAUTIFULLY with NO lumps. If your mixer starts leaKing, do what I did: 1)remove/twist off the base from the plastic cylinder; 2) gently pry up the black gasket and flip it 180 degrees. The plastic is an angled compression fitting and over time the gasket gets compressed. If you flip it, the non-compressed part of the gasket is now doing the work and the leaks should be non-existent for a good long time. It's worked for me."

Whether it be ""Alive or Just Breathing"" with the raw energy of a young KsE or ""The End of Heartache"" with the emotionally driven metalcore that has since become KsE...the beauty and energy was always there. That being said, ""As Daylight Dies"" was an inevitable turn for KsE. The Energy is gone, the beauty is gone and the only reason I'm going this three stars is because of the songs ""My Curse"" and ""The Arms Of Sorrow."" Other than those two songs, this album lacks everything that the last two definitely had. I even found myself laughing at this effort thinking that they cannot be serious with songs such as ""Break The Silence."" If you want good metalcore then go pick up KsE's ""Alive or Just Breathing."" Don't waste your time with this release."

Based on the music alone, I would give this CD 5 stars, but seeing as how it offers less than 40 minutes of music, I can't give it more than 3.

Some of those stories is the stuff you have already heard before. What would really make this book better is photographs. If a reader isn't familiar with the parks they will be lost. The photographs really would enhance the book. The stories do enhance things to a small degree. Most of the stories are the small facts about the little things like the truck driver on test track in Epcot is President LBJ. Walt Disney put little thank yous across the parks to commemorate people who helped him, front companies he used, and of course to honor the mouse.The book isn't very big.

The people at our local bike shop found this terrifying.The seat wobbles and rattles a bit. It seems secure, but the feeling is unnerving. I emailed ibert and they said some people had put duct tape in to stabilize it, but why wouldn't they fix this themselves?Aside from the difficulty of getting on the bike with so little space between the child's seat and yours, the biggest reason we ended up returning it is because there's NO support for the child's head when they fall asleep. Our daughter would last about 15 minutes before she fell asleep, then it was difficult to support her head and ride at the same time.All the bike shops I went to thought that these front seats were a bad idea and now I see why."

But for me, the entire plot quickly short circuited,leaving literary fragments in its wake. By the end, I was asking myself why his editor hadn't done a better job.I look forward to the next effort.

I looked through my room and found Harry Potter. I read the first few chapters and became HOOKED! Just as I finished the first one I went out and bought the second. Two years later, I had read the third and second books at least two times. Sonething about leaving your troubles behind by going on a train far away and meeting new friends was a universal dream that most people have wished for.

The author argues that Castro's success along with the romantic following that Che Guevara acquired, became almost a blueprint for the countless insurgent movements across the region. Interestingly, none but the Cuban revolution ultimately endured because people needed to learn that the Cuban Revolution could only work in Cuba; it was not exportable as Castro, Che and many others had hoped."
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Completely Insulting Within the first few pages of the book, i began to understand the author's purpose, simply debase a culture not her own. I grew up in India and i simply could not understand where all the supposed descriptions were coming from. Real beauty or the ability to see it does not come from having a closed and prejudice mind. The beauty that the author looks for is the generic beauty, found all over the world, but India has the beauty not only by the wonderful environment but the spirit of the people as well. This book really does portray India as some kind of savage land and that is something i cannot put uo with."

The story didn't grab me, and I pushed myself to read through the half way point and then finally gave up.This is not a book I'd recommend to anyone. Not because of poor writing, but because the story wasn't interesting, and the characters were two dimensional. I didn't believe for one minute that any of the events would have occured in real life, and that made it hard to read also.Pass on this one, there are other great books out there to read!"

First of all, the controls take some getting used to (at least for me, i'm more of a madden fan). Second, the running game is non existent. Picking a play is extremely difficult, especially if you do not want a play in the shotgun. When you are passing, the best way to gain yards whaen the recievers are covered is to make your QB run, the computer will not stop you at all. The graphics are extremely better than 2001, it finally looks like a ps2 game, but the players are too skinny and they never show their faces. and this year they also took time to put everyone's name in the game, which they didn't do in 2001.

In comparison to that book, where the specificity of the theme reined in the author's imagination somewhat, RAVEN'S EXILE ranges widely. I think it should be read as a meditation/rant rather than as a factual account or even a memoir. At times the language is poetic; at other times I found it imprecise and over-the-top. Sometimes Meloy's outrage at American culture's lack of concern for wilderness, the hubris of building huge cities in the middle of the desert, and the arrogance of wanting to replace native fish with others that give better ""sport"" is acutely expressed and trenchant; sometimes the text degenerates into idiosyncracy and misanthropy.Recommended, but I tend to think Craig Childs' book on water in the desert addresses the topic better."

The songs here have good melodies and anthemic lyrics that are easy to sing along with. There isn't any soloing by Sambora anymore which is ashame but the songs still have a nice hard guitar sound. Some people are complaining that Bon Jovi doesn't rock as hard as they used to, but they were never a 'metal' band. They sound as loud here as they ever have. This is an experienced band that knows how to play and knows how to write a catchy rock song."

This is the second one of these clocks that I purchased. Only problem with this unit is with finding the right placement of outdoor temp sensor for good signal reception to the clock. Also, re-calibration after replacement of batteries can be a little temperamental. Sometimes, you may need to place outdoor sensor right next to clock to get the initial sync. Then, you can move it to an outside shaded location to give good reading. This unit I bought for my very discriminating neighbor, and he has been very pleased with it. Recommend using high quality long-life disposable batteries to avoid having to recalibrate clock frequently, as would be the case with rechargeable batteries."

If you're looking for covers of Tom Waits songs, may I suggest Temptations by Holly Cole or the 2000 tribute called New Coat of Paint. In these tributes, musicians such as Neko Case(an exceptionally good cover of ""Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis""), Carla Bozulich, Floyd Dixon, Eleni Mandell and Holly Cole not only gave a new spin to Waits' songs, in many cases, they gave a whole new dimension to the familiar tunes.

When our daughter reached 18 months or so, we decided not to put dirty diapers in the Diaper Dekor. Instead we put them in a plastic grocery bag and simply take them directly to the trash outside (there are far fewer now than when she was smaller). We found we were able to use plain white kitchen garbage bags in the Diaper Dekor and they worked fine. We are expecting our second child and will be purchasing another Diaper Dekor.

I mean, it was even mentioned in the liner notes. In this remixed version, however, the echo effect is hopelessly out of sync, rhythmically incorrect, and sloppy sounding.The (...) who remixed and remastered this important work of art should be ashamed of themselves. It seems that they completely disregarded the way the echo was applied so tastefully on the original, and have just sort of slopped it on in a horrible way on this new version.

This is however. a pretty decent story and if you can stand almost non-stop foul language (some people are under the false impression this makes them sound tough) it is worth a rental for adults only. The subject matter and language makes me recommend this to adults only. The story centers around two young men that have a bad string of luck by being found at a murder victims body by the sheriff that killed him. Add to that they are transporting moonshine and off they go to prison for life. Their life time there is spent with some interesting other prisoners, many as much victims of what most blacks suffered up until around the 1970s when their rights finally started to be recognised.

If I forget it while traveling and have to use a face towel, I don't feel as clean. It air dries pretty quickly and I store it in a ziploc for travel.

And then there's the overtly gay Wilem Defoe who portays a gay FBI agent to stereotype-accuracy.

I think the authors do establish that different countries do have different political cultures. However, I don't think the book actually proves its title, namely that culture matters. It's never clear whether culture is a product of political institutions and economic conditions, or vice versa. It's just as possible much of the empirical evidence they cite could be used to justify the claim that culture is merely a manifestation of deeper factors. It's worth a read if you're interested in culture, but don't expect definitive answers."

A fairly strong episode of MST3K, especially considering it's Mike Nelson's first time as the host on the Satellite of Love. The movie is a lurid and gruesome ""B"" grade picture about a doctor who keeps his girlfriend's head alive well past its freshness date while he seeks a body on which to transplant it. The MST3K crew provide many laughs throughout this lurid melodrama, many of them food references as during their Amazing Colossal Man episode of the show. The absurdity of the movie and these jokes really keeps you laughing throughout. Look for the hilarious host segment at the end where they interview ""Jan in the Pan"" played by writer Mary Jo Pehl."

I had never heard KR before and I am thoroughly impressed. Not only does he have amazing chops, but he also has a penchant for playing very quirky yet haunting melody lines, almost like Miles did on trumpet. The song selection is excellent. I think I only skip one or two of the songs, and that's more because I can't wait to get to other ones deeper in the album.Some of this album is slow and poignant, some is swinging, some is afro-sassy. But it's NEVER boring. If you like good jazz, buy this album. I can't wait to get more of his stuff.Highlights for me are: Th Cross, song #4, song #7 and the final track #10.

As a Fantasy fan, I'm amazed that King has moved so easily into writing a series in this genre! My greatest disappointment is that he seems to treat this superbly crafted series as a hobby and lets many years pass between new releases. The excitement fades somewhat as a result.

I'm not a factory worker or construction worker sort, but I'd say I've given this watch a fair amount of abuse and it still looks almost brand-new. A year and a half of wearing it and there are NO scratches on the mineral crystal, no scratches on the rotating bezel, and only minimal wear on the band.

The vibrater on it just makes a very loud noise, but the music and light are very good features to help a little one fall asleep or help you see in the dark. Another complaint I have is fitting the changing table back into the bag. Usually when I pack it up I don't put that in there because it doesn't fit without a lot of wiggling and then I sometimes still can't get it too fit.

Buy this if you want some old-fashioned fun."
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","I kept coming back to it! Frank Clevenger is a burned out psychiatrist whose present course in life can be compared to the Hindenberg. He is experiencing an on and off relationship with both his girlfriend and cocaine. Clevenger is called in as a consultant to a grisly murder in which the victim's breasts have been removed. Eventually the mutilations rise to four, qualifying the perpetrator as a bona fide serial killer. There is a thread among the victims though, and Clevenger will not like what he is about to uncover.Denial has great characterization. Several of the people have gone through horrific childhood experiences in which they have been abused. Keith Ablow is a practicing psychiatrist in Massachusetts and it shows in this book. The jargon and BKM's (best known methods) abound, making for an interesting read. I like to think of this book as a variation of The Verdict in which the loser gets one more chance to pull himself up from rock bottom. I do recommend it!"

The item's description and images should be changed to emphasize that this is only the sheath."

Deedra and the other women are heard by the legal system even when they whisper. It doesn't need to be a fight if everyone is concentrating on our children.

I found Mr. Grandin's linkage of the militarists and the Christian right to be an interesting perspective. However, particularly towards the end of the book I felt that the stereotypes and judgments in the book were overreaching and that Mr. Grandin offered plenty of criticisms of U.S. foreign policy without offering any meaningful solutions."

If Ilan Pappe's work is attacked because it takes a far more nuanced view of the bloody conflict between Palestinians and Israel, then that reason by itself warrants the study of its content. After reading this book, I wonder if some Israelies would still be so dismissive of political equality for Palestinians if it was the Palestinians who had the guns and the military might that Israel enjoys today.

Reminds me of the days i would be up till 3AM with Kings' Quest. Realtively attractive graphics. Few minor problems with speech synching. Sometimes the humor is sophomorish, but usually well-delivered. Not too complicated a program, though you may find yourself a little confused at first about what you have to do. Especially if you're a third-person adventure rookie. This program takes for granted the fact some may not be familliar with the different facets of free-roaming graphic adventures. Otherwise, the program runs smooth on a very low-end system. I have come across very few , and very minor, glitches involving a lock-up (during the point where i was changing the graphic resolution fron 640x480 to 1024x768 ) and one point where i lost sound entirely. But, a reboot fixed that, and it never happenned again. Overall, a nice game with few problems. I enjoyed it almost as much s i wanted too."

Now, that would describe most other books, however this goes above and beyond by giving a VERY complete (IMO) anatomy lesson on the muscles, tendons and so forth. What they do and why they do it and how you can hurt them if you are stupid.I can say with out a doubt this book needs to be in any serious gym rat or health conscious persons library.

""The Perfect Storm"" wants to be a blue-collar, modern day ""Titanic"" with its disaster-at-sea plot. Oh, if only it did. Clooney and Wahlberg are wasted talents in this film about a group of fishermen that get caught in a severely powerful storm. To be sure, the storm scenes sound great on DVD; this is a good movie with which to show off your sound system. But the effects, which get redundant after a few minutes, look and feel fake (almost as fake as Diane Lane's Boston accent!). It's as though you're watching not a catastrophe at sea but a video game at a local arcade. Sometimes, digital effects, when overdone as they are here, can strip a film of its realness. Director Wolfgang Peterson probably wanted to give us a reason to care about the story and its characters, but no such luck. ""The Perfect Storm"" is a near-washout."

But, overall, it's not a bad item."

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Almost perfect for wireless headphones I am very satisfied with these headphones. I first saw these at Fry's for a $120.00. I went home, found them on Amazon, read the reviews and purchased them for only 69.99! What a savings. Yes, you do hear a little hiss, but not more than you would expect for a wireless device. If you are using them to watch television, then you won't even notice the hiss. I wish that the headphones would stay on my head a little better. If I'm washing the dishes and look down, the headphones tend to want to fall off. Not that big of a deal, but I do wish they were a little tighter on my head. I highly recommend them to anyone wishing to use these for watching television."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Correct diagnosis, naive prescriptions This book has not aged well. Many of the problems Nelson has identified are now much worse than when he wrote, but the ""solutions"" seem both oversimplified and impractical. The only problem I know really well is the overuse of prison. Here Nelson proposes solutions that are both politically impractical and practically impossible. There are moving stories here and there which are well used to illustrate his points, but there is also gratuitous obscenity and celebrity bashing. Oh, and a complete absence of reference notes. I suspect this book was dictated rather than written. For the writing and remedies I was tempted to give the book a single star, but it is still worth looking at for the concise cataloging of what is currently wrong with the country, most notably a decline in spirit and increasing class polarization."

I disagree with most of the other reviewers here that this second effort was disappointing - in fact I think it was better than the first. I loved the way the characters of the two sisters changed over the course of this novel to embrace more of what they originally disliked about each other.

Susan Elderkin clearly wanted to confuse her readers and then tell them the ending half way through.I am an avid reader, and I do agree that her character descriptions were good, but the book overall was not suspensful, nor was it intriguing. I've read it 5 times combing it for things for my book report and character profiles, and you find something different every time because of the great detail she uses. So if you're into detail, this book is great. If you want something suspenseful pick up something else. I personally enjoyed ""The Cabinet of Curiosities"" much more than this book...leave this one and go buy the other...you'll be much happier in the end."

His plan is to be in bed with her when the meteor hits. Along the way to her house, he sees society falling apart.

The unit at first worked terrific but after a few months she started having trouble with the ON switch sticking when she tried to turn it on, the unit was not mistreated or damaged in any way. Recently when trying to HotSync the TX the unit quit working all together. We tried charging the unit over night to see if the battery was drained which could have caused the unit to stop working, to no avail the unit is still dead. Although this product has the great name of PALM, the unit itself is not worth the price you pay for the it when the shelf life is less than a year. Palm's customer service for repairs is $129.95+ which is almost half of the original price of the Palm TX. I would not recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a Handheld.

The hole from the bottom of the coffee cone MUST PRECISELY match up with the hole in the top of the carafe, else, the coffee just simply pours out of the bottom of the cone and all over your counter. It's a real mess! Being off-center even just a millimeter results in coffee all over the counter & not in the carafe.The designers of this Zojirushi coffee maker need to take a cue from the designers of the Mr. Coffee coffee maker: allow more space between the bottom of the coffee cone and the top of the coffee carafe/pot."

If your interest in finance is on the practical side then you can safely give this a pass. It reads like Warren Buffett (who is frequently mentioned) is talking to you. I couldn't put it down. It is very hard to describe because it is a series of conversations, choices, and confrontations to the reader. It does explain and show the concept of ""Super Money"" which is really leveraged money very well. That idea is not nearly as transformational now as it was in 1970 but here it is amply explained in a very compelling narrative. The more familiar you are with the behind the scenes world of finance the more you will appreciate the profound insights of the author. The wisdom of the message makes this book an absolute classic."

Of the three stories, they all are extremely good, but I'd have to say that the Office Romance is the best. Unfortunatly each one follows a similar style of writing quality.

Philips no longer makes my old model, so I opted for the 5300. It works fine and I'm sure will offer many years of dependable use, however I feel duped and am considering returning it. My old brush had a two-minute timer that pulsed every 30 seconds, alerting you to switch to another section of your mouth. The product detail for the 5300 mentions the ""2 minute Smart Timer,"" which I thought was the same thing. Not so much. Basically, this one just quits after two minutes. If you want the real ""smart"" timer, I guess you have to upgrade to one of the really expensive models.

It was 99.99$ when i purchased it last week, including the free shipping. Arrived 2-3 days later on the same week. A pretty good deal! I've taken a long ride along the lakeshore, it's quite comfortable, also very pretty!! Especially good for ladies seeking for both comfort and style.I didn't rate it a 5 star only because it didn't come with the tools (like an allen wrench that always comes with furnitures), so you'll definitely need the following tools to assumble it:- a set of allen wrench- open ended wrenchAnd the instruction book was not very helpful. But it wasn't hard to figure out by oneself."
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","poor duration between charges I bought a logitech wireless keyboard/mouse that included these batteries, so when the battery in the mouse would die within just a few hours I figured the battery was bad and decided to buy some replacements.I have to say I'm very disappointed with how short a time you can go between recharging it. If I would leave the mouse on for several days (even without using it) I would have to recharge it as soon as I touched it again. I just gave up and put in a standard Energizer AA in the mouse and have been happier with the duration even if I DO have to change it out from time to time.Hey at least now I just swap out the batt and remain wireless rather than having to be tethered for a couple of hours while it charges.Can't really recommend these."

There are some minor errors in this show but it doesn't effect the bands good spirits and the audience sure is estatic, if you looking for a PJ show that is high in energy and everyone is having a great time, this is it. This show is one of my favorites, it only falls behind Milan and Prauge."
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Terrible - a huge disappointment Just awful. Horrendously overpriced for a crappy, poorly-made item. The ""chrome"" is shiny plastic and very cheap looking. The mechanism barely works (and don't bother trying to use this if you've got even a touch of arthritis OR if you have normal-sized hands -- this is made for giant monster hands). It doesn't crank smoothly or evenly. And the pepper comes out a mix of dust and huge chunks (when it comes out at all) -- for every ten squeezes, you get maybe 1/32 teaspoon of pepper. It would take forever to season whatever you're cooking. There's nothing useful about this product. And there's nothing very nice about it, either. It looks so lovely in the pictures, all sleek and modern and sturdy. But in actuality, it feels and looks like a five-dollar bargain bin item. This is surprising from Trudeau; I own and adore many of their products and find them all to be of excellent quality."

With few exceptions, the Flood had been accepted as universal. Then, in response to the rationalistic preconceptions of recent centuries, the church has largely backed away from Biblical truth, and settled for a local-flood compromise. Sadly, Davis Young, the author, himself is part of this compromising-evangelical community. In particular, his claims that the Ark could never have carried all of the world's animals is patently incorrect. See Woodmorappe, John. 1996. Noah's Ark: A Feasibility Study."

I personally own 14 game systems, and easily over 1,000 games, and this game can't hang with any of them. Yeah, it's fun for about an hour, but lets face it: The game is designed for people that like to be repeatedly killed, often by powers that they can't control. The later levels mostly rely on luck, partially due to the camera (which you can't control or rotate around the monkey). The graphics look like they were designed for the N64, and the ""story"" feels tacked on and has nothing to do with the game. Many people talk about how great the mini-games are, but they are much less sophisticated than those in Mario Party (and also are fewer in number). I just think Sega can do better."

Due to a necessity to create and explain the technological aspects of her future world, C.S. Friedman is forced to expend energy away from the narrative, thereby sapping some of its force and energy. As this is a recurring complaint that I have with much science fiction, perhaps this criticism is an individual response and should be weighed against those who find interest in the technological and theoretical concepts that I find often overburdening this genre. Those among you who turn to science fiction for its theoretical content will undoubtedly find my criticism over harsh, and I expect will enjoy this work immensely. Nonetheless I find the storyline weakened by the explanatory excursions into brainware systems, data codes, virus creations, and Guild operations. My loss, perhaps."

It's also a hardback, unlike Gordon's Aerofax works. Every model is covered, as well as every nation that has used the Hind.The author is honest, telling the good and the bad of the Hind (or ""Crocodile"" as it was called by the Mujahideen). The Soviets studied American helicopter use in Vietnam and decided an assualt helicopter was a good idea, but unlike any other nation, they built in troop carry capabilities. Anyone interested in aviation,especially helicopters, will enjoy this book. It's a bit pricey for a modeler, but worth every penny. Highly recommended."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","It's more a grammar than a language course If your intention is to learn to speak Maltese, just don't buy this book since it won't be helpful at all. It is more a grammar than a language course and it would be ideal for those who have already learnt the basics of Maltese and wish to have a grammatical reference whenever they hesitate about the language rules. Very few exercises and quizes, and not useful at all in which concerns to learning Maltese, no dialogues in the whole book, and very ""hard"" explanations about the language. I gave it one star because of its cover, which is the only nice thing in the book. If you're looking for a good language course in order to learn Maltese, my recommendation is to buy ""Beginning Maltese"", by Lydia Sciriha (University Of Malta)."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Very mixed results I guess I'm in the minority because I've had very mixed results. I took a chi running clinic in December and PR'd in a half marathon about five week later, by 18 minutes. I felt like I was having a running renaissance at age 44, but that only lasted another few weeks. Since then, I've been plagued by injuries. At this point, calf injuries have kept me from running for about 2.5 months, which makes no sense as the chi running books (and I have both of them) claim that you don't use your calf muscles with the method. That didn't make much sense to me when I read it, and it certainly doesn't now. So I guess my advice is not to expect a miracle cure and recognize that some of the advice and statements in these books make little sense from a medical standpoint--perhaps because the authors have no medical training. That said, I've been to plenty of sports docs and physical therapists over the years, and they weren't very helpful, either."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A performative contradiction The point of these confessional memoirs is to let us into how self-aware other people are--or at least that's something that's often claimed about them. But Texier's own unselfawareness, her own unwillingness to really be self critical beyond a few scattered moments, her inability to get beyond the sarcastic and repeated question, ""what did I do to you,"" point up the difference between life and art. Texier confuses sex and love, and thinks that she can bind this man to her continually, even though he explains that he doesn't love her anymore, by passionate and wild sex, and then asks in a condescending and obviously insincere way, ""so what did I do wrong?"" This memoir demonstrates the narcissistic self-obsession that probably caused the relationship to collapse in the first place. It gets two stars because it generates a sort of voyeuristic sex based need to keep on reading, almost against one's will."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Typical greatest hits collection.... Typical greatest hits collection in the sense that it omits numerous great songs by the artist. In Ozzy's case, there is no ""Diary of a Madman"", no ""Flying High Again"" (!), no ""Ultimate Sin"", all classic songs which rank with Ozzy's best, and are glaring omissions from this album, which bumps my star rating down a notch or so.However, the material that is provided is an ideal introduction to Ozzy. If you enjoy this album, I would recommend buying Ozzy's solo albums individually, especially ""Diary of a Madman"" and ""Ultimate Sin"".Final note: Ozzy's inclusion of ""Back on Earth"" was a good one, this song ranks right up there with any of the hits included on this album, and any hit Ozzy ever had. A shame it was excluded when ""Ozzmosis"" was released."

Somehow I failed to read the fine print and thought I was getting live Todd performances with some interviews.

It all just becomes rather uninteresting after the first thirty minutes of the movie. Some really interesting and timeless issues are being touched upon and the story is so loaded that there is true epic potential. However, the presentation is so weak and un-involving that you just want the movie to end fifteen minutes earlier.Being a video gamer I was a little disappointed and hope for a reboot (or do-over) of this animated movie."

Maybe with a hit Gary West would have chosen to stay with the band. Now all we have is Shooting Star part II, a pale and poor substitute. This one is worth it if you find it cheap because the first three songs make a great addition to a career retrospective, plus there is the addition of the previously unreleased songs from the ""Up The Creek"" soundtrack.

This type of packaging also makes it difficult to remove and replace the discs without scuffing them.

I made an effort to find several books that might tend to enlighten me more and this work by author Pagels wound up in my library.Unfortunately this work seems to be somewhat obfuscatory and misleading. Yes , the author describes the discovery of the Nag Hamadi documents , and gives an adequate background of the history of Gnosticism , but I was not looking for a book review of the Gnostic Gospels , but for the original works translated. Pagels admits to having an ""orthodox Christian"" background , and tends to minimise the importance of the historic find.Overall the book is valuable , but needed to include some rather lengthy translated excerpts from the original works to be taken more seriously."

I would say maybe a 50' range if you are indoor/outdoor. If you were grilling outdoors and were staying within the 100' range outside, you would probably be okay. Also, if you were using it inside cooking with the stove and kept the reciever indoors as well, the range is acceptable. I do like how there is a digital readout on the probe unit as well, so if you are moving around indoors/outdoors, you can see the temp at either unit(provided it is in range).

It also goes into ideas like horizontal and vertical improvisation without making it too intimidating, and introduces some blues ""cliche"" endings and turnarounds. It covers many different styles from barrelhouse to stride to jazz blues.The included CD lets you know how this stuff is really supposed to sound, and it's got a full ""Recommended Listening"" in an appendix if you want to explore further.

So much of a disaster I wonder if Mr. Irving isn't playing some sort of a game with us.

The book focused most of the attention on Billy Durant, instead of Alfred Sloan, which in turn made the title more interesting. It is a good story about how one mans drive can change the world as we know it, and it can also ruin him. I would recommend this book to a friend or relitive.

The color is terrible and the transfer is very bad.Making Armin Mueller-Stahl the love interest of Morgan Fairchild is casting insanity. He could easily be her grandfather so a good bit is lost trying to accept that twosome.The movie itself is hard to grasp because the police station looks like a garage with busted toilets sitting in the hallways. Nothing is real about the movie plus it would appear the cameraman had no grasp of light versus dark. At times, you can't even recognize where a scene is taking place because of the darkness.Save your money and don't buy this DVD.

I think Gabriel did a wonderful job of conveying his character's angst and conflict. I was really upset when he and Athos became enemies after Athos's son was killed. John Malkovich was also great as Athos, both grieving and vengeful. I thought the bond he formed with the good twin, Phillippe, was touching. Jeremy Irons seemed a little too detached as Aramis, but he still did a good job and was a perfect straight man for Gerard Depardieu, who was wonderfully crude and disgusting as Porthos."

It is as rich in characterization and intrigue, though on a quieter and more familiar scale. I also felt I got a good sense of what life was like in the 1960s for the regular people who lived through a decade that's often portrayed as nothing but sex and drugs and student protests.

(In undeveloped countries this is not so interesting because the culture that exisited before and after the war is so barbaric anyway. (like Somalia or Iraq)). But the scene in Germany and Japan just after WW2 was kind of interesting because it was highly developed countries, especially nazi Germany.

This is an interesting take on the funeral rites of many famous people. I won't go into detail because this has already been done more than adequately in the first customer review. I was particularly fond of the manner in which the material was presented. I felt that the written accounts of the funeral rites discussed within presented a verbally visual sense of being there.The subjects discussed were from quite diverse levels of celebrity. The information presented was in some cases as much reflective of the historical time frame during which they occurred as well as the individuals being honored.This was a very interesting exhumation of information long buried and forgotten.

Some of the holes are too shallow, and quite frankly I was afraid to take a drill to it. It looks nice in the room and while it isn't wobbly, you wouldn't want to put your weight on it or anything.

The songs were distasteful yet they add excitement to the original story. Scrooge's transition was not only emotional, it was also physical. Near the end of the production, Scrooge's face became rosier and his eyes glistened. The director left many important details out of the movie.

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Very subtle in places Okay, so it's not a Stephen King classic, but this movie left me with hope for mankind. Sort of a lofty review for such a simple movie I know, but if you watch it for entertainment value you can pick up on some very subtle plot twists. Why did his daughter have a thing for leaving water glasses around? Why did the alien invasion have anything to do with Mel Gibson's charcter's waning faith? I thought it was a great movie and the humor injected into the spooky parts was very entertaining. Don't expect an epic film, but it is worth watching. I'd recommend it."

I chose it pretty randomly, and ended up loving it so much that just today I bought another book in the 'Preaching the Word' series. This book really brought to life the early church for me, and continued to ignite feelings in me that the contemporary church just doesn't have it figured out at all. It's a great thing to read in the mornings with a bowl of cereal and your Bible. :)"

They are simple to assemble (tedious, but simple) and can be adapted to fit in most any space. They fit the intended software well and give me great service. I used some simple handyman skills to stack two of them vertically and then stand them shoulder to shoulder to completely fill a 8'x8' closet. I also added castors to the feet of six more units that stand in front of the closet units. It is possible to load them with too much weight at the top which makes them prone to tip, but each unit includes a strap to attach it to a wall to prevent tipping. My units are solid, strong and completely satisfying. Great for anyone who needs to fill a space by adapting modular units. Very Useful!"

I may be a little too critical, however, because after only about 200 washings they loose a little of their luster. Imagine that!?! One of the nicest things about these glasses is the delicate thinness of the lip. It just makes sipping wine (or anything) more elegant."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","AN EMPTY NOVEL While admiring Bishop Robert L. Wise for approaching the mystery genre via the Christian faith, one still can't forgive Wise for bringing us a rather dull and empty book. THE EMPTY COFFIN sets the stage for an interesting murder, but it gets sidetracked so many ways, including Raymond Bench's accidental murder? of a liquor store manager. Add Vera Sloan's incessant nagging, whining and seemingly a lack of understanding of her husband's job and you have a novel that goes nowhere fast.Sam Sloan's interrogation of Ape is so redundant, it seems like Wise is simply padding. Sloan's daughter comes across as a miscreant Pollyanna. You know who the killer is so fast that there's little suspense in getting him to admit it. Slow, with some ghastly editorial errors, THE EMPTY COFFIN is the first in a new series. Hopefully, Wise will get wise and start thinking about his reader's interests---mystery. The Christian element is fine, but just write more interesting works."

And in the second place, I found it to be simply a poorly written novel. Yes, I admit that it's plot devices were entertaining but the book is one plot device after another with absolutely no character development.

The ""cool"" visuals and over-the-top action sequences are complemented by classic noir themes and (especially during the ""That Yellow Bastard"" segment) subtle and intelligent symbolism. The characters are processed and amped-up representations of their film noir archetypes, and the actors play their parts perfectly. Mickey Rourke's performance is undoubtedly the highlight, much to my surprise. The DVD is lacking in aspects such as special features, and I had trouble playing it in a certain DVD player of mine, but that might have been the fault of the (rather old) player. It worked fine in all other players I've tried, so this shouldn't be a deterrent from buying it. This is a great film and well worth owning for repeated viewings.

I read two chapters on a mountaineering weekend by flashlight and as a result remember his entire idea about the struggle of history being a ""striving for the realisation of freedom."" His whole definition of Freedom is also adequately layed out in the book.Although it is asking a lot in 122 pages to lay out Hegel's ideas, he does a good job. He connects Hegel with modern convervatism and you can see where the current obsession in the US Bush admin could come from and there is also the traditional interpretations of Hegal ""being stood on his head"" as understood by Marx. There is even an interesting section on freewill that has implications for modern marketing techniques.All in all this is a great book."

I also like when the dvd includes any behind the production interviews from actors,writers, producers, directors."

Some of the songs are nearly unrecognizable and some just lose all steam. Like the MTV Unplugged series...sometimes just sitting down with your instruments doesn't qualify for acoustic or stripped down. It's just lazy and sometimes sad. But not all styles and songs work acoustically, and some just turn out lame.However, some, like Billy Idol, Men at Work and Rick Springfield really make it work. Thomas Dolby is stripped, but far from acoustic - perhaps to much to ask from such a techno-sound and basically unfair. Howard Jones is remarkable - as is his audience. Some nice moments, but only half of it really works. Perhaps the fault is whoever chose the tracks or the artists to try this."

I don't know what the running time is for Hannibal Rising, but my guess would be 540 minutes. At least that's what it felt like. A mish-mash of quasi Nazi-Asian ancestor worship/revenge was a witless ploy in an attempt to build some sort of plot. There is no backbone here, nothing to lead to the Hannibal we all know and love.

I was distracted by the poor quality of the writing, technically speaking, although it did improve as the book went on. More importantly, I found that the story line was weak, and Blume was stretching to entertain her audience rather than augment the story with her excessive, redundant sex scenes.Contrary to another reader's opinion, I was not impressed with Blume's description of the book's settings, or with her development of the characters.To sum it up, I don't recommend this book.

Expecting another book about estate planning, I was pleased to find only the essential data needed to introduce the subject and the bulk of the content about thoughtfully (and prayerfully) making the six decisions about wealth transfer. This is the first book I have read by Ron Blue but I suspect it is one of his best. Intertwined between the chapters teaching us about the six decisions of wealth transfer are sole searching questions, historical examples of heros in philanthropy, and humorous cartoons introducing each chapter. But the real treasures in this book are the biblical references with reminders of the definition of stewardship in nearly every chapter - ""God owns it all"""

To some this may be disconcerting, but I commend the writer for respecting her audience enough to challenge their imagination and intellect. That said, I found this story to be less engaging than some of her other works. I would have preferred the story to say more about the boy of the book's title. Overall, I believe that this book is very appropriate for youths fourth grade and older."

The opening number, ""Rocketman"" is guaranteed to get this old guy up and dancing and moving, and is a nice homage to the Elton John song of the same name, to which it bears no musical resemblance.

This film attempts to go behind the ""melting pot"" analogy and show that, like Andrei said what holds us together is the understanding of all of our differences. There is far more to it than just a ""lets show people who are difference across the nation"" aspect, and if you pay close attention to the verbal dialogue, especially his small soliloquies you will get far more out of it.

After hearing this ""Debut"" I can only express my deepest ""Disappointment."" True, Licitra has a basically dark, not unattractive tone and a sense of authentic Italian ""slancio."" What he lacks is a proper sense of line, comfortable control of dynamics, and - above all! - elegance. It is all too tight, coarse, and crude. Compare Licitra's ""La parterna mano"" to Bergonzi's and note the latter's superior line. Björling's ""Donna non vidi mai"" displays the elegance Lictra lacks. Even the uneven and wayward Di Stefano has more bounce and joy than Lictra does in ""Di tu se fidele"" not to mention real heart-felt pianissimi in ""E lucevan le stelle."" By the time I came to Lictra's ham-fisted approach to ""Celeste Ada"" I was ready to stop this disc and reach for the Björling recital on Naxos where half the price delivers twice the voice and three times the musicianship."

Many moons ago, I heard this chick trying to sing a Spanish version of her song ""Luka."" It really made me cringe like nothing other has since.

Same sort of category of Edie Brickell, Cowboy Junkies, etc. I mean that in a, was-good-at-the-time-only-in-very-limited-quantities-at-that kind of fashion. Vega was by no means a Kirsty Maccoll (R.I.P.) who she seems to have fashioned herself after, even trying to hook up with Billy Bragg as it were. But, I guess she was marginally ok at what she did, for the limited time she did it.Dig it up for the novelty of it all, try to find the Spanish version and laugh/cringe/cry, and then shove it back in the attic."

Why not just toss her in as is?""The response of Michael Schiavo's supporter: ""why not indeed?""This is why this book is so important. More books why Michael and his supports are dead wrong need to come out in order to show the travesty of justice putting Terri to death was.Imagine, we have 11 million illigal immigrants getting in to have enough pay and food to live, and Michael, his ghoulish lawyer, and the disgusting judges all conspired to put her to death simply because she was not perfect. whats up with that?"

But it is still so easy to miss a small detail and remain completely lost despite reading it over and over.The positive reviews are likely from people who knew a lot of the content before hand and appreciated the unified theory approach that brought their knowledge all together. Students on the other hand will not appreciate this book until they are at a fairly advanced level already."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A horrible, incomprehensible novel As I picked this book up off the shelf without prior knowledge to whatever fiction universe it belongs to, I must base my review solely on this book. In other words, other books in the ""Known Space"" series may very well be better, but I couldn't stand ""A Darker Geometry"".The first three or four chapters are intriguing, and kept me reading. I must say I enjoyed the way life in space and the kzinti perspective were handled -- you really got into the minds of the characters for a while. However, incomprehensible nonsense such as the conversations between the ""Outsiders"" added absolutely nothing to the book, and probably took a lot away. Physics and philosophy bogged the story down rather than giving it flight. I barely made it through the book. The ending was also poor.All in all, I think the only people I could recommend this book to are fans of the Known Space novels, or people with lots of free time to try and figure out the philosophical aspects of this book."

He does not exagerate a single bit the characters, events and astonishing facts represented in the book.

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Read elsewhere ""To a stranger driving 99,"" Joan Didion explains, ""these towns must seem so flat, so impoverished, as to drain the imagination."" Her attempts to then refute the accusation--as well as those attempts by her colleagues--fails in utterly and dismally epic proportions.Highway 99 disappoints terribly in its attempt to move the reader into some kind of passion for California's Central Valley. Even the selections from the most famous and established authors fall short of that goal. Even the composition of the book--its inner margins reduced so that the words disappear into the spine--disappoints. Only the pictures really provoke any dreamy, wistful imagination."
5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Great closeups The best thing about this edition is the extreme closeups of many of the paintings. It is interesting to see how Van Gogh applied his paint. Occasionally the paintings are printed side-by-side with the original sketches that inspired the paintings, another great insight into Van Gogh's technique. The first 50 pages (of 150 pages) are about Van Gogh's early work which is darker with a browner palette, a phase I don't enjoy as much. But this is typical of books on Van Gogh. Some of the reproductions don't seem very crisp which seems odd for a book printed in 1999 by the Van Gogh Museum (which should have had the leisure to get good photographs).This isn't the best book on Van Gogh but it has features not seen in other books. Plus it is available for a good price especially in paperback. Because of the closeups and the larger-than-usual reproductions of a few paintings I love (like ""Undergrowth"") this book rounds out my Van Gogh book collection rather nicely."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Memoir of John Lennon by former employee If you consider the source and the inherently self-serving nature of books like this, you will find some valuable information here on the last years of John Lennon's life. Green's central contention is that Lennon's withdrawal from public view until just before his death was due to a severe form of writer's block and not any desire to be a ""househusband,"" which sounds plausible enough. The chapter on Paul McCartney's pot bust in Japan has some instructive information, and Green's general tone is moderate and free from now-it-can-be-told sensationalism in the Albert Goldman manner."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A little gold, but I was mostly in the dark As other reviewers have noted, this book is difficult to peg and, sometimes, to follow. As a (sort of) history book written by a literature professor, this is not surprising. The subtitle, ""Scenes from the Life"", is apt; while there are plenty of anecdotal gems, it doesn't provide a systematic and comprehensive overview of the city's history nor put it into a larger context. The strongest parts are those describing the occasional cooperations, but more frequent tensions, between Prague's Germans, Czechs, and Jews. Often billed as a tourist's introduction to the city, Demetz spends long sections on some pretty arcane literary history without really telling the layperson why he should care. There is an irony here too, since the last section is a 10-page, somewhat self-indulgent, gripe about how the city has been ruined, largely by tourists. If you are planning a trip to Prague and want to know more about the city, I think you can do better."
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Useful, but needs a finer publisher This book and its companion piece on the Roman republican era are enormously useful for a person like me who went to the Eternal City with very specific sightseeing goals. Both are like conversations with someone who's been there and knows the shortcuts to the history and how to get to the locations. Easy to carry around and gets to the point immediately. The one detraction is that the publishing is a bit of a home job and pictures are missing, smeared, or otherwise not terribly useful. But these books, plus a standard Lost Planet Guide To Rome, are really all you need to get around and really capture the essence of both the obvious must-sees and the more obscure sights that you'll be glad you took the time to investigate."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","sleeping with ne win Wendy Law-Yone is a Chinese/Burmese lady, daughter of a well-known journalist in Burma.

I don't know how true the story is or whether it has anything to do with Wendy Law-Yone's own experiences, but it is interesting for me, as a burmese man (who used to read his father's editorials!), to find out what Wendy has to say about Burma. She writes well though (like her dad!). The book is worth the price!"

I cannot seem to find any information about them changing it though. On my cover it has each of the host club members with different facial expressions. However, this anime does have great quality, story, and humor. It would definitely give 5 stars if it wasn't for the different box set. The only reason I am giving this product three stars is because it is not what I was expecting.

Also while the author is fascinated and appreciative of the Arab culture, her bias surfaces every now and then as she belittles (no matter how subtle) other peoples from poorer Asian nations. That was a big turn-off. Overall a very fairytale view by a Westerner which is too good to be true."

Very flimsy in general, which is too bad, because we loved the old Elegant/Saddleman product. We have searched high and low on the internet and all the auto parts stores for a quality bubble cushion, but we are convinced that they no longer exist."

The best protein I have tried to date is by far Body Fortress Super Advanced Whey Protein. The price is much better, it contains everything optimum has plus more more recovery supplements already in it. It feels much more filling and tastes far better. I would recommend staying away from optimum nutrition. If you don't believe me, just try Body Fortress yourself. You can get a 2 pound container for only $15 at Walmart or several other stores/sites. You won't regret it. You will regret optimum nutrition after trying body fortress though."

A little bit more freedom would have resulted in a much more interesting album. It's like a soundtrack to a some trendy TV show.The guy does his best with the songs he's been given. He has such a good rock voice that it is a shame to hear it going to waste with a pile of generic unmemorable songs. Afterall this is a guy that became popular singing songs he liked that were almost entirely alien (Allman Brothers, Badlands, Jim Croce...) to the core audience of American Idol.Next time let the guy really do his thing.

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","2 stars for Goodwin and Foster Essentially this dysfunctional film implodes on itself in numerous ways, so much so that any description of the plot or otherwise would just be boring. The only two reasons to see this would be to watch the range that Ben Foster and Ginnifer Goodwin have. I liked Foster in 3:10 to Yuma and I think this role helped show his variety, as with Goodwin.This is not a film to grab if you think Hillary Swank, Perry or Graham do anything special. Swank has 5 scenes, Perry spends half the film on a toilet (toilet humor does not work for me anymore) and Graham just seemed to miss it. Watching Perry scoop dog crap up well over ten times didn't work for me either. I like the films from First Look, but this one doesn't meet the grade of competency, except for Foster building a solid foundation - and when I think about it he actually had more screen time than anyone, so maybe they should change the cover art to him."

After a ton of work the rooms looked ehhhh.In comes this book. After just spending ten minutes reading through the clearly laid out steps that the author provides, I found at least four things I had been doing wrong. It was as if a light bulb just went off over my head. The next day, using pre-painted pieces (great tip btw!!) my wife and I completely installed crown molding in a room with several funky corners.

Although I specifically looked for a vertical briefcase, its bulk makes me realize I would have been better off with a padded rolling backpack.

It's a pleasure to hear some instrumental interludes as well (""Song C,"" etc.). ""Spirit Trail"" is a unique and worthy contribution to American music.However, the album could have been improved tremendously by leaving out a few weak tracks. In particular, ""Preacher in the Ring"" (recorded in two different versions, no less) is both musically uninteresting and lyrically stupid (is Bruce trying to make fun of actual religious fundamentalists, or is this his ""clever"" way of comparing Christian conservatives with snake handlers?).Buy this album, but don't be afraid to skip over a few tracks."

The actor who portrayed ""Skellig"", Tim Roth was excellent.Eliza's Horoscope has to do with Indian culture, mysticism (which I usually enjoy) and death. All in all, I was a bit lost."

What did that have to do with the story? While I felt very bad that Sheila was brutally murdered, I think Ann Rule tried to make Sheila this poor helpless creature when infact, Sheila had lots of avenues to take if she really wanted to get away from Alan. I love Ann Rule's true crime however, this time she definately missed the mark."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",Somewhat disappointed At first I was eager to order this CD as a replacement for the original one with the same title. This copy does not have all of the original songs on it and for that reason I was disappointed. I guess they thought they would separate the songs and make two CD's thus making more money than having all of the original songs included. The quality is very good - it's just that many of the medleys and songs that I liked on the original were cut from this release.

This is a fascinating book, showing what was the spirit of Indians, through this war chaman that Geronimo actually was.

I rate it on the 5 best books I read in my life, and I've read thousands, being a book reviewer in a French magazine.Read this"

Each chapter focuses on one aspect of money. At the end of the book is a brief summary of each chapter with some questions that can be used as a study guide to focus on the important aspects of that chapter. MacArthur also includes some ideas to focus on during your prayer time as well as some scriptures to memorize and apply in your life.This is a good book to read for anyone interested in learning a Biblical perspective on money. Of course as a Christian we need to remember that our true riches are in Heaven."

Waste of money and disappointment in this author whose novels usually offer a nice little get-away. I'll be more careful in the future of pre-ordering her ""new"" books!

It was a well designed, sturdy scoop with a attractive cover. After an international move, I decided last month to buy a new copy of the same model. This is NOT the same product! As others have mentioned, there are three big problems. First, and least significantly, the stickers on the cover are almost impossible to remove. Second, the entire construction is very flimsy and bends under the stress of a large clump. Third, and most grievously, the scalloped edge makes the easy task of cleaning a box with clumping litter into a nightmare. It cannot clean against the edges (especially the rounded edges of a Booda dome.) It rips well-formed clumps to shreds, making a sticky and seriously gross mess.Don't trust this item's overall high rating or the older favorable reviews.

His strength is writing about the Navajo community and making Native American culture integral to plot resolution. It is great when I can enjoy a light mystery novel and feel I have learned something about a culture I am not very familiar with. I have counted on his accuracy since he seems to have the endorsement of the Navajo community to represent their culture in his books. This book, with emphasis on Washington, a few mentions of Homeland Security and Osama bin Laden, takes him away from where I perceive his strengths to be.His characters always seem to lack depth. They seem to exist to move the plot along. It would be great if he could write one of these books wherein he explores the inner life of some of his characters in a sustained, deep and meaningful way."

Her second mistake is to describe language as ""arbitrary,"" a rather loose use of the word for someone with little good to say about prescriptive arbiters of language. That's her third mistake: She cannot bring herself to admit that change can be bad and that prescription often serves good purposes, like making it easier to conceive and communicate difficult thoughts, and making it possible for people to communicate with other people from different times and places."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","It was ok I personally didnt like the movie that much. Think I would of liked it better if I had not read the book, but I did. So I pretty much hated the movie, but loved the book. It was an awesome book, with a lot of suspence, and a good ending. Then I see the movie, and its totally changed! The entire second half of the book isnt even in the movie. Not a good ending at all. If you really want to know more about the firm, read the book, dont go and rent the movie. It seems like they tried to get more into the relationships of the people in the movie, where its more suspencefull in the book, dealing more with the mob and the F.B.I. I was going to go buy the movie because I loved the book some much. Good thing I didnt."

5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","exactly what it claims to be While it isn't the most fascinating book I've ever read, this lives up to its title. It is an unusual, but very effective, introduction to basic economic concepts for people who would rather die than crack open an economics textbook. The choice of real-world examples and the generally humorous tone make the learning painless. I skimmed the glossary before I started and was intimidated by the quantity and complexity of some of the terms that were used, but by the time I had finished reading the book and took another look at the glossary, I found I was comfortable with the terms and concepts. Highly recommended."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Dull A sad little film about murder, lust, and sex. I believe that the film wanted an erotic flavor to it, but naked people do not erotica make. A girl is apparently missing and her family hires a lesbian detective to find her. I don't think it mattered too much if the detective was a lesbian, but she falls for a self absorbed bi-sexcual married female professor, Kelly McGillis. The story revolves around finding where and if the girl was murdered. Kelly McGillis was so unattractive that I couldn't concentrate on the story. I'm straight, so I might have spent too much time thinking why the dectective, Susie Porter was attracted to Kelly McGillis and it could have ruined the film for me, but I came away wishing I had not wasted time on the film. I did manage to figure out the ending half way through so that was another bummer. I can't see why anyone would like this film. Kelly McGillis looked like Susie Porter's grandmother by the way."

We are starting out with out full inversion but it really did take the pressure and pain off my spine where my disc is bulging. Also felt it pop my back almost immediatly. Back hasn't been able to pop in over 2 yrs, that actually felt good as well. The ankle holders feel nice and stable. I like this table and hope it continues helping my pain. So far it looks to have been a wise purchase. I did not give it 5 stars because it just came today and I wanted to leave room for error since nothing is perfect :)"

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","an excellent book This is a well-written, entertaining book. I read it mostly due to my interest in sea-faring and the ""age of sail,"" as the author terms it. However, I found myself enjoying it just as much for the story it tells about the gradual discovery of a cure for a disease that crippled sea-faring nations for centuries. Particularly enlightening is the story of the bureacracy, the British Admiralty, that stubbornly ignored the potential cure, even as it suffered tremendous losses for its ignorance, and how vital privilege and influence is in challenging and changing such an establishment. The book's only minor flaw is that it focuses primarily on one country, Britain, without elaborating on how or why France or Spain failed to find a cause and a cure. I would recommend it highly."

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Music for mosquitos I became interested in Sigur Ros () after finding a YouTube video segment of a live performance of Track 7. I wish that I had not spent money on this album.The first few tracks really set the tone for the album. Music for mosquitos, with Asian influences. As is noted by other reviewers, the lead singer repeats a nonsense word/phrase over and over, throughout the album. The music is conventional and droning. The first tracks contain something that is very reminiscent of a mosquito buzzing my ear while I try to sleep. This has more in common with jazz than rock, more like what a rock band might do if they had to fill an hour jam session with atmospheric stuff.This isn't electronic, its too annoying to be ambient, and has too much conventional rock to be ""post-rock."" I recommend Debussy's Jeaux, and Jean-Michel Jarre's Zoolook to this. (Right now I'm listening to Corsican Chant to get this out of my head.)"

It does have all the new bonus tracks which are great indeed and it also has the Promised Land CD ROM game with a booklet and a nice fold out sleeve, but over all this is a cheap way to package up these classic Queensryche recordings, when compared to the individual remasters that come with the lyrics and artwork.

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Great product but be careful in microwave An excellent and very versatile set of 3 glass bowls, good for transporting food, mixing sauces, even baking (something like a small cornbread). The lids are tight fitting and durable. Just be aware that the glass heats VERY hot in the microwave and this doesn't seem to be unique to my oven. I actually used one of the larger bowls to microwave (air pop) popcorn on a whim. I used no oil and set the timer for two (2) minutes. Popcorn popped really nicely but the glass was extremely hot to the touch even with oven mitts. It would be very dangerous for a child or even an elderly person to use these unsupervised.

However, it is definately not a piano book, the notes are not arranged for that - just a simple one-handed tune. I was disappointed That most songs only have one verse and the chorus.

I added these ankle weights to everything I do in the water and now I can't imagine swimming without them. I was able to use them as packaged, full weights, right away (decades of swimming paying off). I use webbed gloves on my hands along with them. I've used these swimming the side stroke, breast stroke, crawl, underwater, swimming on my back, treading water doing leg lifts and even upright dancing in the shallow end to music. I use these in both deep and shallow water. I also do surface dives with them. I now feel strange swimming without them. I miss the resistance if I don't include these weights in my swim. If and when these give out, I will be buying a new set within hours. Two caveats: one, make sure these are snug on you as if they are loose they interfere with swimming; two, you must be a very strong swimmer to use these in deeper water. A weaker swimmer might panic with the added weight with disastrous results."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Good idea... bad execution I saw the trailers for Regin of Fire and thought: cool - a movie about dragons and fire! that should be fun.Well, yeah, the concept is great, but the execution was terrible. If they weren't going to make the plot even remotely interesting, the least they could have done was make the movie wall to wall action, ya know? Seriously, kicking dragon butt for an hour and a half would be entertaining when you are in the mood for that sort of thing.Special effects were not all that great. Didn't stink, but not good either. A lot of really interesting ideas and concepts, but none of them explored at all. The movie seemed like one big brainstorming session - a lot of good nuggets, but nobody bothered to pick out the good ones and expand them into a good moive."

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A contrived soap opera set in a fascinating culture. The Kite Runner has some admirable features; however, compelling story-telling is not one of them. The descriptions of Afgan culture and society, before, during, and after the Taliban, are the novel's only redeeming features. The story line reads like it was written by a bright high school student. It uses the worst, most transparent plot devices and cliches. I laughed out loud at several of the most predictable points in the book, and believe me, this is no comedy. I think that too many of the reviewers here are being generous because of the very worthwhile descriptions of Afgan culture, one that we Americans ought to know a lot more about than we do. As a work of literary art, this book fails in some very obvious and compelling ways. No committed reader of fiction could take the plot seriously, but it still might be worth your time if only for the cultural dimension alone."

On my installation both sensor wires and the switch wire were too short. You can make it work by running the wire directly on a diagonal, but this looks bad.

But the scope is limited and affordable enough - four albums - where most fans can get a complete picture without these bits and pieces."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","It's a good flat iron, at first I've had this flat iron for about two years. When I first purchased it, it was wonderful. I used it alot on my hair and others. I have very coarse and thick hair so i usually require alot of heat. and this flat iron worked well. and then after about a year, it didn't get quite as hot. I notice my hair is dull after use and not shinning like it was in the beginning. The cord has a short in it now, and it just cuts off without warning. So after I tired of constantly fumbling with the cord and got use to the fact that it doesn't get as hot as it use to, I have retired this flat iron. I now own another brand and don't even use the infiniti anymore. For first time users this is probably a good tool. its easy to use and doesn't burn or scorch the hair. and it's reasonably priced. I can only give it three stars though, because i expected it to last longer than 2yrs."

In fact, this is I-can-barely-fog-a-mirror stupid.Planes tend to stay in the sky because if one thing goes wrong, they have redundant systems and robust designs, so the pilots can work around the problem.

2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","It does the job, but does it have to be so big? I have always been a big believer in cable/remote releases. I use a tripod whenever possible and a remote trigger is essential when you want to eliminate any chance of vibrations. I have been experimenting with a technique known as HDR (High Dynamic Range) where you take between 3 and 6 shots of the same scene at different exposure settings (see my humble example under ""Customer images"") and merge them together into one photo. For this, as well as many other situations, a cable release is absolutely necessary.My only complaint (more of a question) is why, in this age of digital circuity, is this thing so big? It could easily be the size of a thumbnail but it is fairly large. Anyway, I am glad that I have it."

The atmosphere has to be the best part of Silent Hill. It's just phenomenal. It plays like a Stephen King book. And it stays with you even after you turn it off. All I can say is,this could make a terrific movie. The puzzles in the game start off mind numbingly stupid, but get tough, real tough, as the game goes on. I finished the game without a walkthrough, but I had to think. Neanderthals need not apply. The story really draws you in, and it's neat that your charecter isn't some gun toting commando who never misses. On the other hand, this game never made me jump out of my chair, or gasp, like RE, and that is somewhat disappointing. The also just lacks that something that RE seems to have. You don't know what it is but it just feels like somethings missing. Still, it's an excellent game, and though i still prefer RE to it, this game runs a very close second."

The designs are the bare basic. Although there are many 'designs' they are all the same. The plans are all basically the same and by showing one or two of this type would have been enough for the reader to adapt to whatever positioning they needed. However it goes over and over and over the same plan with a tweek here and there rather than exploring different plans foundations, drainage and the like. There are much better books out there. Also the seller listed this book in good quality and it was riddled with underling and reader notations that were just...well. I would not recommend this book."

He teaches us that in that process God cuts off the non-productive branches, enabling the desirable branches to grow stronger and more fruitful.He makes a powerful statement on page 34 when he says ""No one ever gets close to God without an overwhelming sense of impurity and frailty."" Attitude is a vital key in the overcoming time in the midst of difficulty. Dr. Nelson says if our attitude is right, the trials will make us stronger.I highly recommend this powerful book.

What a deal that is! I recommend anyone looking for new spatulas to purchase this set."

Low quality. Something that I would expect to be given away as a promo for Harbor Freight Tools. There is a much nicer and larger copy of the Gator Tool for 21 dollars on amazon and it is stainless steel. Even the Jackson Tool is 5-10 times the quality in my opinion and I have a lot of purchases under my belt. Do some research before you buy this item. Lesche Co is pretty proud of this thing and I have no idea why. If I would have seen this before I purchased it I would have only taken it as a free or promo item.

But when I got this for christmas uhhhhhhh the box...stank. The quality of the music stank. The DVD had only one music video and it wasnt the most famous one (Smells like teen spirit). Most of the DVD was just home footage and it gets really boring after a while. If you want a real box set go out and buy all of there albums. Dont waste your money on this. The box set scores points for its cool booklet inside and if you put your fingers on the back of the dark set it will do this cool trick where it well turn white where you can see everything so it kind of tyes in with th name with th lighs out.Nirvana ROCKSSS but this bow set SUCKS!!!

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A prototypical B-Movie in book form Richard Laymon's, ""The Cellar,"" is straight up your quintessential B-Movie reconfigured into book form. All the elements are intact - gory and savage violence, a high body count, graphic and disturbing sexual content and some nasty, twisted 'bad-guys' to keep things interesting.Originally published in 1980, this book still manages to feel 'contemporary' as there is nothing by way of story/setting to date this book back a quarter century ago. With a brisk pace and constant flow of violence and action, those looking for a bit of mindless literary entertainment will find the experience satisfying like a good B-Movie should."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Great idea, bad design I really wanted to like this product, however it failed miserably for its intended use because the main screw slides freely through the top, making it unable to mount onto anything. I must have just gotten a faulty one since I didn't see others report that issue. However, the whole design is also not really appropriate either, it has a very heavy thick metal yet its supposed to clamp onto a delicate telescope eyepiece. Also its not really designed with modern cameras in mind because I would have had to adjust the elevation to the very maximum to be able to center my Nikon coolpix on it. Its kind of clunky too, not a precision instrument. If I could redesign it I'd make the entire frame a lighter yet sturdy plastic and have it more precise in its adjustments. I might have to fabricate my own since this one is going back to Amazon and I don't see any other options."

It brews fine, but SHUTS ITSELF OFF after 4 hours. Auto shut-off was not a feature mentioned anywhere, even in the user's guide. We have also found the gold filter frustrating, as there are often fine grounds in the brew. Water fill reservoir is also a bit awkward to use...toward the back adn rather small for my elderly mother to negotiate well without spilling. We have tried to remedy this by putting the coffee maker on a glass tray so she can slide it out toward the edge of the counter to fill it. The tray also catches any ""mess"".

HM2K does out shine its predecesor for having a more complete story, but it was not exactly what I was expecting (especially since it have several opportunities of the sex).

She also presents deafness as just another characteristic and not an unsurmountable challenge-it is accepted as a difference, but not something to be embarrassed about. She shows that not all people approach being deaf in the same way-some sign, some vocalize, and hearing aids are not viewed any differently than glasses. I highly recommend this book."

Angsty college rock revivalists Black Helicopter turn back the dial about 20 years and do it up Buffalo Tom meets Dinosaur Jr. style on their disappointingly uneven debut Invisible Jet. Featuring members from since defunct but relatively well regarded Boston based groups Kudgel and Green Magnet School, Black Helicopter have played with the likes of Sonic Youth, Shellac, and Mission of Burma. And yet, paradoxically, despite their impressive resume, Black Helicopter stands out as anything but. The phenomenally derivative and incredibly trite Invisible Jet is about as profound as a 13 year old girl's diary and equally as relevant. In all a less than mediocre record from a band that had the potential to produce something fantastic. Ultimately, however, they end up sounding like less than the sum of their influences. (For what it's worth, `Head of Steam' is an awesome song... play it, everything else... not so much)."

But you have the option of typing it in (if you know it). Right click on the song and you can import it to itunes!Sure you might hear a little snippet from a commercial, but come on its free music!

Not Brock (and several others, including Robert Crawford). This sonnet is so straightforward, so natural, so conversational, so unselfconsciously self-doubting, that the fact that it is an Italian sonnet, conforming to the rules of line, meter, and rhyme, yes, but also the structure of the argument, could easily wisk by without notice in a reading. I immediately sent off for the book and was not disappointed.

Lord knows how the record store is financed or much else.Overall, this is a movie that is not original and as it's supposed to be a ""soul searcher,"" it doesn't move you either.The only real amusement came when Darlene from Roseanne made a brief appearance and when the ""Boss"" made a cameo."

May not have quite the viewing angle as plasma; however, you wouldn't enjoy watching TV at that extreme angle anyway. Plasma and LCD look like great pictures behind a shiny piece of glass. This picture on this set is so life-like it's incredible."

Those guys swing SO good - it's incredible!! All the tracks are very cool even though they're all different....and this cd contains my favourite wash-up-music, too!! :)"

1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","You lose money and time After setting up my first recorder I realized that the tray does not open. A part inside was bent and stopped the tray at the front panel! If you have not believed it yet: they do not have any quality control. The second unit was a challenge. It just did what ever it wanted to. I'm a computer freak and know a lot about electronics, but this one will drive you crazy.Finally it refuses to respond to any button.If only the support at Cyberhome would respond to your questions. The only thing I can think of is they are overwhelmed with unsatisfied customers and cannot handle all the issues reported to them. If you decide to buy: Good Luck! You will need it. Cyberhome will get two things from you: your money and your error reports."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",The whole Saga of Seven Suns series I could go into detail about all the disappointing aspects of these books but I'm not going to waste any more time with the series.- Unbelievable dialogue- Unbelievable storyline- Unbelievably repetitive (to stretch it to seven books)I regret buying the books.
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Just take it for what it is... Of course, when the title says ""Greatest Songs Ever,"" you need to look at the list of tracks and decide for yourself whether or not you agree. So this is someone's subjective list of greatest songs ever. But it's a fun CD. Kind of a mish-mash of everything, but a good mood-booster."
5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Very pleased with this kettle The Toastess TJK-55 is a well designed kettle that works very nicely. Others have lids which are so tight you cannot open them, this one closes tightly but is still easy enough to open for filling. It heats water quickly and pours well. Ours gets used at least twice a day and it is a pleasure to use it."
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Probably the cheesiest ad for an online dating service I've ever seen Yes, inside the box was a free one-year membership to the online dating service in the movie. But, why would anyone in their right mind want to use them? Let's see: our heroine ends up accidentally going out on a date with and discovering her would be amour is none other than her widowed father--whose lies on his own application started with his age. We go on to see the 50ish widow her father is dating lying about her age and ending up with a 15 year old (oh yes, he lied about his age, too) on her doorstep claiming they were soulmates. Well, they did have some interesting things in common. Add to that the crying neurotic guy, the 50ish guy who really wanted an 18 year old, etc. The movie itself lacked the timing or style to be anything but a 'dog' and the advert for the online dating service just sealed the deal for me."
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",The Saboteurs You can tell that this book was not written by W.E.B. Griffin alone. It is not his style of writing which is uniquite and holds you attentive so that you do not want to put it down. I was quite disappointed in the book.
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Disappointed Growing up with Lite Brite, I was very excited to see it available for my kids. I bought 2 - for less than 10$ each. The first one doesn't turn on, the second one won't shut off. Will be calling to see what Hasbro will do. They were not easy to find so I am not very optimistic that this will have a happy ending."
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Aaron Carter rerun This DVD was OK, of course I love aaron, but most of the stuff on the video was repeates from tv. IT DID though contain a few not before seen stuff, but otherwise all of it was off tv.So if you missed it get it, or if your like me and have to have everything go ahead!"
3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?",They are not so good as their previous albums Forget about Cruelty and the beast - Midian - Dusk and her embrace. This album is bad. It reminds me a little Nymphetamine with the childish melodies and the boring atmosphere. Its one of their worst albums and its only for Cradle Of Filth collectors.
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","SOS History This cd is a waste of time and money. What little information it has is not current. Each chapter says to look up information about your state and write a 250 word report. I could have told my kids that, for free! You also cannot set the calendar to the current year. It would make it more difficult to assign work, if there was any."

4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","It was okay This video was okay...I mean, the basic premise is that of a few other videos out there...it's okay to be sexy. That in itself is great.This video is too similar in alot of ways to The Art of Exotic Dancing for Everyday Women, which is one of my favorites and I've had for years! It just isn't as good.Yes, I was disappointed. I suppose I learned a little bit more than I already knew but it wasn't worth the $20+ ."
4,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Dune: The Butlerian Jihan This book is writtin in the spirit of the original Dune series, but it is lacking the profundity and complexity of the original. It is an entertaining read, but I am left wondering if I'd be nearly as engrossed if I wasn't already a fan of the Dune universe. Definitely worth reading, but don't expect to be nearly as challenged as you would be by any of the Dune books written by Frank Herbert himself."
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","A cheap ruffle! I,too, almost purchased a white Koala Baby dust ruffle to go with a Classic Pooh & His Honey Pots comforter. I saw it at Babies 'R' Us and couldn't believe how poorly made it was. The fabric was flimsy and the length of the drop was shorter than any dust ruffle I have ever seen. Also, there was no hem on it; it was just sewn over! Probably the cheapest quality baby item I've ever seen!"

3,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","DaVinci Commode I finally succumbed to the will of friends and read this garbage. While at times quite the page-turner -- in a formulaic, manipulative way -- the superficial treatments of the ""great mysteries of the ages"" dismantle the whole premise. I'm certainly no cryptographer as the hero is renowned to be, but I was figuring out the ""clues"" long before any of the characters were. And the argument that the Bible was a matriarchial text before King James got his hands on it is an old one, so nothing learned there."
2,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Compact and light This butane powered lantern is very small and compact compared to other models, it doesnt weight much and you dont have to worry about breaking any glass. The only problem is that it provides about 60% of a mantle lantern light and is a bit more yellow. Also the light is more concentrated in a 180 degree radius because of the mirrors. However if you plan to camp for more than a couple of days, this is the best deal."
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","TOO HARD FOR YOUNG CHILDREN-DOESN'T DESERVE ONE STAR My 5 year old daughter received this as a gift for her birthday. The game requires A LOT of reading to play. The box says recommended for children 4+ but many children cannot read at this level at that age. I played the game and found it frustrating and my daughter was easily frustrated, and even cried because she couldn't play without my help (with the reading). THis game is way too complex for young children, and it is supposed to be geared towards them."
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","DANGER: Almost killed my dog! I am highly recommending you DO NOT give your dog Greenies. My German Shepherd was given one by a friend. He loved the taste and ate it wholeheartedly. However, within a 24 hours, he was vomiting blood and taken to the vet's emergency clinic. Not only did the product tear up his throat, but he had an intestinal blockage because the Greenie did not digest easily. He was at risk for emergency surgery, but my vet was able to help him pass it. He had to be on an IV for a week. Folks, the packaging on Greenies even says it is fatal if not thoroughly chewed. DO NOT RISK IT! I almost lost my best friend."
5,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","The militant poet in once again, check it... There is something about this album that I can't put my finger on, it seems to have some of type of control over me. I still listen to this album just about every single day. That's how powerful Rage Against the Machine's music really is. It's completely different from many other bands out there, lyrically and instrumentally. Tom Morello's guitar riffs really are something, probably some of the best guitar playing I've heard in a long time. And of course can't forget Zach's powerful lyrics, inspired by freestyle rap. Each song from this album is different from each other, while they may carry the same political message, they're all gems to my ears. This album is the greatest thing to come from 1990s, and probably one of the greatest albums of all time."
1,"Is this sentence very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?","Sickening and manipulative An insulting vehicle displaying how great a person Robin Williams is. I can't believe anyone wouldn't want to take a shower after the scene where the ""terminally ill"" children show up to his hearing with the red noses on. How bad of a movie maker do you have to be to take a true story and make it unbelieveable. It's ironic that a movie which touts non-conformity is made up of formula and cliche. If you liked this movie, you need to examine your life and appreciation of art."

They've used up all the ""goop"" and we have a pile of creepy-crawlies which they are having lots of fun with. It's easy and the results are really impressive. I didn't think the lack of a light bulb was a big deal. So, the kids had to wait a day for dad to pick up a bulb. Whatever. It was worth the wait. The kit really is neat. Kids love creating things and little boys are wow-ed by the nifty results. Very creepy little critters. I'm here on Amazon shopping for some refills so the kids can continue their fun."
